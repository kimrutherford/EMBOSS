<h2>Authentication</h2>
</center>

This is concerned with verifying that a particular username and
password is valid for a given user on your platform.

<p>The various authentication choices are either platform specific
(e.g. for AIX and HP-UX) or more general. Most of the time
you'll be able to use to following options but see the notes
below.
<p>

<table noborder CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<td><tt>a) Linux</td><td><tt>--with-auth=shadow (or --with-auth=pam see
                                PAM notes).</td><tr>
<td><tt>b) Irix</td><td><tt>    --with-auth=shadow</td><tr>
<td><tt>c) MacOSX</td><td><tt>  --with-auth=pam</td><tr>
<td><tt>d) AIX</td><td><tt>     --with-auth=aixshadow</td><tr>
<td><tt>e) HP-UX</td><td><tt>   --with-auth=hpuxshadow</td><tr>
<td><tt>f) Solaris</td><td><tt> --with-auth=rshadow</td><tr>
</table>

<p>For AIX and HP-UX the above are the only possible choices.

<p>If the above options do not work or you have a different
operating system then here is a description of the possible
choices which will hopefully guide to in selecting the
correct one. Many will work with NIS (e.g. shadow, rshadow).

<p>1. noshadow

<p>In general this is used if your system has a /etc/passwd file
which contains encrypted passwords and only a getpwnam()
system call (man getpwnam). 

<p>2. rnoshadow

<p>This can be used if your system has a /etc/passwd file
which contains encrypted passwords and your system has the
re-entrant getpwnam_r() call (man getpwnam_r).

<p>3. shadow

<p>This can be used if your system has a /etc/shadow file (or
equivalent) and your /etc/passwd file therefore does not
contain encrypted passwords. It is used when the you only
have the getspnam() and getpwnam()  system calls
(man getspnam, man getpwnam).

<p>4. rshadow

<p>This can be used if your system has a /etc/shadow file (or
equivalent) and your /etc/passwd file therefore does not
contain encrypted passwords. If your platform has both the
getspnam_r() and the getpwnam_r() re-entrant system calls
then use this option (man getspnam_r, man getpwnam_r).

<p>5. PAM

<p>A possible choice if you have PAM set up but one of the
above options might also work. See the <a href="pam.html">
notes on using PAM</a>.
For example, on most default RedHat Linux installations
both 'shadow' and 'pam' will work but PAM requires a little
extra effort to set up.

<p>6. aixshadow

<p>This is solely for AIX systems. It uses the getuserpw()
and getpwnam() system calls.

<p>7. hpuxshadow

<p>This is solely for HP-UX systems. It uses the getspnam()
and getpwnam_r() system calls. It also checks for
'trusted' setups with the iscomsec() system call.


<p>If your system fits into none of the above categories then
the authentication will not work. You should then contact
us (emboss-bug@emboss.open-bio.org), preferably with details of
which system calls your platform uses for authentication,
and we will hopefully be able to incorporate your system's
authentication scheme into the EMBOSS distribution.
