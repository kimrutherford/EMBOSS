Function

   Extract codon usage tables from CUTG database

Description

   Given the name of a directory containing the CUTG database, cutgextract
   will calculate codon usage tables for individual species (e.g.
   EHomo_sapiens.cut) and place them in the CODONS subdirectory of the
   EMBOSS data directory. This is an all-or-nothing extraction; it will
   create many files and take several minutes. The usage tables are
   calculated from the sum of codons over all sequences for each organism.

Algorithm

   cutgextract looks in the specified directory and opens all the files
   with the extension '.codon'. These are all expected to be CUTG data
   files. It then parses out the codon usage data and writes one file per
   species into the EMBOSS data/CODONS directory. The names of the files
   are derived from the species names in the CUTG files. These files names
   will be long and therefore descriptive.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with cutgextract


% cutgextract
Extract codon usage tables from CUTG database
Codon usage directories [.]: data
General log output file [outfile.cutgextract]:

Notes

   The EMBOSS distribution includes a set of codon usage tables calculated
   from the files listed in
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/codonusage/README), with a few
   additions whose exact derivation cannot easily be determined. Many
   people would prefer to create their own from the public CUTG data. The
   CUTG database can be downloaded from
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg.

   If you run cutgextract on the CUTG database from
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg all of the *.codon files
   included in the database will be processed. You may need to uncompress
   these files (*.codon) before running cutgextract on them.

   cutgextract would normally be used once when the EMBOSS package is
   installled, or when a new version of the CUTG database is released.

   CUTG has a drawback: it has a table for each organism without making
   the distinction between different gene populations.
