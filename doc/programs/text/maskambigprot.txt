Input file format

   maskambigprot reads one or more protein sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

  Input files for usage example

  File: ambigprot.fasta

>AMBIGPROT
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ*
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz*

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS sequence file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -osformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq,
   excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions, seqtable, simple, srs,
   table, tagseq.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.
