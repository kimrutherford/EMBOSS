Function

   Masks all ambiguity characters in protein sequences with X

Description

   maskambigprot replaces any ambiguity codes in the input sequence with
   'X'.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with maskambigprot


% maskambigprot 
Masks all ambiguity characters in protein sequences with X
Input (gapped) protein sequence(s): ambigprot.fasta
