Function

   Align EST sequences to genomic DNA sequence

Description

   est2genome aids the prediction of genes by sequence homology. It aligns
   a set of spliced nucleotide sequences (ESTs cDNAs or mRNAs) to an
   unspliced genomic DNA sequence, inserting introns of arbitrary length
   when needed. Where feasible introns start and stop at the splice
   consensus dinucleotides GT and AG.

   By default, est2genome makes three alignments: First it compares both
   strands of the spliced sequence against the forward strand of the
   genomic sequence, assuming the splice consensus GT/AG (ie in the
   forward gene direction). The maximum-scoring orientation is then
   realigned assuming the splice consensus CT/AC (ie in the reversed gene
   direction). By default, only the overall maximum-scoring alignment is
   reported, and then if it scores higher than a specific minimum
   threshold score. Optionally, all comparisons may be reported.

   The program outputs a list of the exons and introns it has found. The
   format is like that of MSPcrunch, ie a list of matching segments. This
   format is easy to parse into other software. The program also
   indicates, based on the splice site information, the gene's predicted
   direction of transcription. Optionally the full sequence alignment is
   printed as well.

Algorithm

   The program uses a linear-space divide-and-conquer strategy (Myers and
   Miller, 1988; Huang, 1994) to limit memory use: 1. A first pass
   Smith-Waterman local alignment scan is done to find the start, end and
   score of the maximally scoring segments (including introns of course).
   No other alignment information is retained. 2. Subsequences
   corresponding to these segments are extracted 3a. If the product of the
   subsequences' lengths is less than a user-defined threshold (-space
   parameter), i.e. they will fit in memory, the segments are realigned
   using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm, which will give
   the same result as the Smith-Waterman since the subsequences are
   guaranteed to align end-to-end. 3b. If the product of the lengths
   exceeds the threshold (a full alignment will not fit in memory) the
   alignment is made recursively by splitting the spliced (EST) sequence
   in half and finding the genome sequence position which aligns with the
   EST mid-point. The process is repeated until the product of the lengths
   is less than the threshold. The problem reduces to aligning the
   left-hand and right-hand portions of the sequences separately and
   merging the result. 4. The genome sequence is searched against the
   forward and reverse strands of the spliced (EST) sequence, assuming a
   forward gene splicing direction (i.e. GT/AG consensus). 5. Then the
   best-scoring orientation is realigned assuming reverse splicing (CT/AC
   consensus). The overall best alignment is reported. The worst-case
   run-time for the algorithm is about 3 times as long as would be taken
   to align using a quadratic-space program. In practice the
   maximal-scoring segment is often much shorter than the full genome
   length so the program runs only about 1.5 times slower.

   The algorithm has the following steps:
    1. A first-pass Smith-Waterman scan is done to locate the score, start
       and end of the maximal scoring segment (including introns of
       course). No other alignment information is retained.
    2. Subsequences corresponding to the maximal-scoring segments are
       extracted. If the product of these subsequences' lengths is less
       than the area parameter then the segments are re-aligned using the
       Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which in this instance will give the
       same result as the Smith-Waterman since they are guaranteed to
       align end-to-end.
    3. If the product of lengths exceeds the area threshold then the
       alignment is recursively broken down by splitting the EST in half
       and finding the genome position which aligns with the EST
       mid-point. The problem then reduces to aligning the left-hand and
       right-hand portions of the sequences separately and merging the
       result.

   The worst-case run-time for the algorithm is about 3 times as long as
   would be taken to align using a quadratic-space program. In practice
   the maximal-scoring segment is often much shorter than the full genome
   length so the program runs only about 1.5 times slower.

                                  strategy is used to control the memory
                                  requirements. In this way very long

  MSP type segments

   There are four types of segment,
    1. each gapped Exon
    2. each Intron (marked with a ? if it does not start GT and end AG)
    3. the complete alignment Span
    4. individual ungapped matching Segments.

   The score for Exon segments is the alignment score excluding flanking
   intron penalties. The Span score is the total including the intron
   costs.

   The coordinates of the genomic sequence always refer to the positive
   strand, but are swapped if the est has been reversed. The splice
   direction of Introns are indicated as +Intron (forward, splice sites
   GT/AG) or -Intron (reverse, splice sites CT/AC), or ?Intron (unknown
   direction). Segment entries give the alignment as a series of ungapped
   matching segments.

  Full alignment

   You get the alignment if the -align switch is set. The alignment
   includes the first and last 5 bases of each intron, together with the
   intron width. The direction of splicing is indicated by >>>> (forward)
   or <<<< (reverse) or ???? (unknown)

Notes

   est2genome uses a linear-space dynamic-programming algorithm. It has
   the following parameters:
parameter               default         description

match                   1               score for matching two bases
mismatch                1               cost for mismatching two bases
gap_penalty             2               cost for deleting a single base in
                                        either sequence,
                                        excluding introns
intron_penalty          40              cost for an intron, independent of
                                        length.
splice_penalty          20              cost for an intron, independent of
                                        length and starting/ending on
                                        donor-acceptor sites.

space                   10              Space threshold (in  megabytes)
                                        for linear-space recursion. If the
                                        product of the two sequence
                                        lengths divided by 4 exceeds this then
                                        a divide-and-conquer strategy is used
                                        to control the memory requirements.
                                        In this way very long sequences can
                                        be aligned.
                                        If you have a machine with plenty of
                                        memory you can raise this parameter
                                        (but do not exceed the machine's
                                        physical RAM)
                                        However, normally you should not need
                                        to change this parameter.

   There is no gap initiation cost for short gaps, just a penalty
   proportional to the length of the gap. Thus the cost of inserting a gap
   of length L in the EST is
 L*gap_penalty

   and the cost in the genome is

min { L*gap_penalty, intron_penalty } or
min { L*gap_penalty, splice_penalty } if the gap starts with GT and ends with AG
                                     (or CT/AC if splice direction reversed)

   Introns are not allowed in the EST. The difference between the
   intron_penalty and splice_penalty allows for some slack in marking the
   intron end-points. It is often the case that the best intron
   boundaries, from the point of view of minimising mismatches, will not
   coincide exactly with the splice consensus, so provided the difference
   between the intron/splice penalties outweighs the extra mismatch/indel
   costs the alignment will respect the proper boundaries. If the
   alignment still prefers boundaries which don't start and end with the
   splice consensus then this may indicate errors in the sequences.

   The default parameters work well, except for very short exons (length
   less than the splice_penalty, approx) which may be skipped. The intron
   penalties should not be set to less that the maximum expected random
   match between the sequences (typically 10-15 bp) in order to avoid
   spurious matches.

Comments

                   Thu, 29 Mar 2001

                    I found est2genome having problems finding very short exons with the
                    default parameters.

                    With the folowing changes it detects also a 14bp exon correctly:

mismatch 1 -> 3
intronpenalty 40 -> 20
splicepenalty 20 -> 10
minscore 30 -> 10
