Function

   Filter noisy data from molecular weights file

Description

   mwfilter removes unwanted (noisy) data from mass spectrometry output
   in proteomics. It reads an input file with a list of experimental
   molecular weights and writes the same data to an output file but with
   unwanted (noisy) data removed, at a specified ppm tolerance.
   Optionally the deleted molecular weights are shown. It removes those
   molecular weights which are:
     * Contaminating trypsin or keratin
     * Modified oxy-methionine or oxy-threonine
     * Peaks associated with sodium ions.

   The last two operations can be done as most peaks are reported in both
   modified and unmodified forms. Removal of modified peaks aids in
   database searching for protein identification.

Input file format

  Input files for usage example

  File: molwts.dat

874.364756
927.450380
1045.572
1068.397129
1121.431124
1163.584593
1305.660840
1428.596448
1479.748341

1748.611920
1753.745298
1880.841178
2383.99

   The input file is a simple list of the experimental molecular weights.
   There should be one weight per line.

   Comments in the data file start with a '#' character in the first
   column.
   Blank lines are ignored.

Output file format

   The output is a list of the molecular weights with the unwanted
   (noisy) data removed.

Data files

   The program reads the data file Emwfilter.dat for the molecular
   weights of items to be deleted from the experimental data.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
