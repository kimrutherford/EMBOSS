Function

   Identify and plot CpG islands in nucleotide sequence(s)

Description

   cpgplot identifies CpG islands in one or more nucleotide sequences. The
   ratio of observered to expected number of GC dinucleotides patterns is
   calculated over a window (sequence region) which is moved along the
   sequence. The calculated ratios are plotted graphically, together with
   the regions which match this program's definition of a "CpG island" (a
   CG dinucleotide rich area). A report file is written giving the input
   sequence name, CpG island parameters and data on any CpG islands that
   are found.

   The ratio of observered to expected number of GC dinucleotides patterns
   is calculated over a window of user-specified size (-window parameter).
   The window is slid along the sequence and the ratio recalculated until
   the end of the sequence is reached.

   By default, cpgplot defines a CpG island as a region where, over an
   average of 10 windows and not less than 200 bases, the calculated (%G +
   %C) content is over 50% and the calculated Observed/Expected ratio is
   over 0.6. These conditions can be modified by setting the values of the
   appropriate parameters.

   The Observed number of CpG patterns in a window is simply the number of
   times a 'C' is found followed immediately by a 'G'.

   The Expected number of CpG patterns is calculated for each window as
   the number of CpG dinucleotides you would expect to see in that window
   based on the frequency of C's and G's in that window. Thus, the
   Expected frequency of CpG's in a window is calculated as the number of
   'C's in the window multiplied by the number of 'G's in the window,
   divided by the window length.
Expected = (number of C's  * number of G's) / window length

Notes

   "CpG" refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases. Regions of
   genomic sequences rich in the CpG pattern or "CpG islands" are
   resistant to methylation and tend to be associated with genes which are
   frequently switched on. It's been estimated that about half of all
   mammalian genes, and, possibly all mammalian house-keeping genes, have
   a CpG-rich region around their 5' end. Non-mammalian vertebrates have
   some CpG islands that are associated with genes, but the association
   gets equivocal in the farther taxonomic groups. The detection of CpG
   island upstream of predicted exons or genes is evidence in support of a
   highly expressed gene.

   As there is no official definition of what is a CpG island is or how to
   identify where they begin and end, we work with two definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. cpgplot and newcpgreport use a sliding window within which the
   Observed/Expected ratio of CpG is calculated. For a sequence region to
   reported as a CpG island, it must satisfy the following contraints:
   Observed/Expected ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Sequence Length > 200

   2. newcpgseek and cpgreport use a running sum calculated from all
   positions in a sequence rather than a window to produce a score. If
   there is not a CG dinucleotide at a position, the score is decremented,
   if there is one, the score is incremented by a constant (user-defined)
   value. If the score for a region in the sequence is higher than a
   threshold (17 at the moment) then a putative island is declared.
   Sequence regions scoring above the threshold are searched for
   recursively.

   This method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around
   primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method as cpgreport but the
   output is different and more readable. For most purposes you should
   probably use newcpgreport rather than cpgreport. It is used to produce
   the human cpgisland database you can find on the EBI's ftp server as
   well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   newcpgseek and cpgreport both now display the actual CpG count, the (%C
   + %G) and the Observed/Expected ratio in the region where the score is
   above the threshold.

   The geecee program measures CG content in the entire input sequence and
   is not to be used to detect CpG islands. It can be useful for detecting
   sequences that might contain an island.

   As there is no official definition of what is a cpg island is, and
   worst where they begin and end, we have to live with 2 definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. newcpgseek and cpgreport - both declare a putative island if the
   score is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment). They now also
   displaying the actual CpG count, the % CG and the observed/expected
   ration in the region where the score is above the threshold. This
   scoring method based on sum/frequencies overpredicts islands but finds
   the smaller ones around primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method
   as cpgreport but the output is different and more readable.

   2. newcpgreport and cpgplot use a sliding window within which the
   Obs/Exp ratio of CpG is calculated. The important thing to note in this
   method is that an island, in order to be reported, is defined as a
   region that satisfies the following contraints:

   Obs/Exp ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Length > 200.

   For all practical purposes you should probably use newcpgreport. It is
   actually used to produce the human cpgisland database you can find on
   the EBI's ftp server as well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   geecee measures CG content in the entire input sequence and is not to
   be used to detect CpG islands. It can be usefull for detecting
   sequences that MIGHT contain an island.
