Function

   Searches protein sequences with a sequence motif

Description

   patmatdb searches the input protein sequences for the specified
   sequence motif. The output is a standard EMBOSS report file including
   the number of matches between the motif and each input sequence, length
   of match, start and end positions of match, and the motif-sequence
   alignment. Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern
   used in the PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating
   dot '.' and the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.

Algorithm

   Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional. For example:
   [DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C means two Asps or Glus in any order followed
   by His, Ser, any residue other then Pro, then two of any residue
   followed by Pro followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.
   The search is case-independent, so AAA matches aaa. (Any string of at
   least 2 characters).

                                  database. For example:
                                  '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C' means two Asps or

Input file format

   patmatdb reads in one or more protein sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

  Input files for usage example

   'tsw:*' is a sequence entry in the example protein database 'tsw'

  Pattern specification

   Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.

   The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows.
     * The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.
     * The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
       accepted.
     * Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids for
       a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For example:
       [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
     * Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
       brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
       position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
       and Met.
     * Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'.
       (Optional in patmatdb).
     * Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
       following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
       between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4)
       corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
     * When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
       sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or
       respectively ends with a `>' symbol.
     * A period ends the pattern. (Optional in patmatdb).

   For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern:

[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C

   This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
   residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro
   followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.

   The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq,
   draw, restrict, excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions, seqtable,
   simple, srs, table, tagseq.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/ReportFormats.html for further
   information on report formats.

   By default the output is in 'dbmotif' format.
