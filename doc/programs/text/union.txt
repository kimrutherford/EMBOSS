Function

   Concatenate multiple sequences into a single sequence

Description

   union reads in several sequences, concatenates them and writes them out
   as a single sequence. The input is typically a list file containing
   references to multiple sequences or subsequences (regions of a
   sequence). Optionally, feature information will be used.

   The output can have source features generated which document composite
   sequences in the EMBL/GenBank feature table. The -findoverlap optin
   checks for overlaps between adjacent joined regions and reports them in
   the overlap file.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with union

   The file 'cds.list' contains a list of the regions making up the coding
   sequence of 'embl:x65923':


% union
Concatenate multiple sequences into a single sequence
Input (gapped) sequence(s): @cds.list
output sequence [x65921.fasta]:

Input file format

   The input can be any set of sequences in a file of multiple sequence
   entries or in a List file. The sequences are concatenated in the order
   in which they appear in the file.

  Input files for usage example

  File: cds.list

tembl-id:X65921[782:856]
tembl-id:X65921[951:1095]
tembl-id:X65921[1557:1612]
tembl-id:X65921[1787:1912]

   You may find the program yank useful for creating List files.

   The result is a normal sequence file containing a single sequence
   resulting from the concatenation of the input sequences.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   union is most useful when the input sequences are specified in a "list
   file". A list file contain references to any number of sequences which
   are retrieved from some other file or database. Each sequence reference
   is a Uniform Sequence Address (USA) which can include the specification
   of sub-regions of the sequence, eg. em:x65923[20:55]). Specifying
   several such subregions in a sequence or sequences allows you to enter
   disjoint sequences to be joined.
