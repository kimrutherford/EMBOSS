Function

   Reads sequence fragments and builds one sequence

Description

   union reads in several sequences, concatenates them and writes them
   out as a single sequence.

   It is most useful when the input sequences are specified in a List
   file. The List file (file of sequence names) can be any set of
   sequences in files or database entries specified in the normal EMBOSS
   USA (which can include the spcification of sub-regions of the
   sequence, eg. 'em:hsfau[20,55]'). Specifying several such subregions
   in a sequence or sequences allows you to enter disjoint sequences to
   be joined.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with union

   The file 'cds.list' contains a list of the regions making up the
   coding sequence of 'embl:x65923':


% union 
Reads sequence fragments and builds one sequence
Input (gapped) sequence(s): @cds.list
output sequence [x65921.fasta]: 

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

Input file format

   The input can be any set of sequences in a file of multiple sequence
   entries or in a List file. The sequences are concatenated in the order
   in which they appear in the file.

  Input files for usage example

  File: cds.list

tembl-id:X65921[782:856]
tembl-id:X65921[951:1095]
tembl-id:X65921[1557:1612]
tembl-id:X65921[1787:1912]
