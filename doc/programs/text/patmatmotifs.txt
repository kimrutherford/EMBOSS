Function

   Scan a protein sequence with motifs from the PROSITE database

Description

   patmatmotifs reads a protein sequence and searches it against the
   PROSITE database of motifs. It writes a standard EMBOSS report file
   with details of the location and score of any matching motifs.
   Optionally, full documentation for matching patterns is given in the
   report. Optionally, simple post-translational modification sites are
   not reported. PROSITE must be processed by running prosextract before
   running patmatmotifs.

   The home web page of PROSITE is: http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/. Quoting
   from the PROSITE user's documentation:
   "PROSITE is a method of determining what is the function of
   uncharacterized proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences. It
   consists of a database of biologically significant sites and patterns
   formulated in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it
   can rapidly and reliably identify to which known family of protein (if
   any) the new sequence belongs.

   In some cases the sequence of an unknown protein is too distantly
   related to any protein of known structure to detect its resemblance by
   overall sequence alignment, but it can be identified by the occurrence
   in its sequence of a particular cluster of residue types which is
   variously known as a pattern, motif, signature, or fingerprint. These
   motifs arise because of particular requirements on the structure of
   specific region(s) of a protein which may be important, for example,
   for their binding properties or for their enzymatic activity. These
   requirements impose very tight constraints on the evolution of those
   limited (in size) but important portion(s) of a protein sequence. To
   paraphrase Orwell, in Animal Farm, we can say that "some regions of a
   protein sequence are more equal than others" !

   The use of protein sequence patterns (or motifs) to determine the
   function(s) of proteins is becoming very rapidly one of the essential
   tools of sequence analysis. This reality has been recognized by many
   authors, as it can be illustrated from the following citations from two
   of the most well known experts of protein sequence analysis, R.F.
   Doolittle and A.M. Lesk:

   "There are many short sequences that are often (but not always)
   diagnostics of certain binding properties or active sites. These can be
   set into a small subcollection and searched against your sequence (1)".

   "In some cases, the structure and function of an unknown protein which
   is too distantly related to any protein of known structure to detect
   its affinity by overall sequence alignment may be identified by its
   possession of a particular cluster of residues types classified as a
   motifs. The motifs, or templates, or fingerprints, arise because of
   particular requirements of binding sites that impose very tight
   constraint on the evolution of portions of a protein sequence (2)."

   It is common to find that a search of the PROSITE database against a
   protein sequence will report many matches to the short motifs that are
   indicative of the post-translational modification sites, such as
   glycolsylation, myristylation and phosphorylation sites. These reports
   are often unwanted and are not normally reported. You can turn
   reporting of these short motifs on by giving the -noprune option on the
   command-line.

Input file format

   patmatmotifs reads a single protein sequence.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq,
   draw, restrict, excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions, seqtable,
   simple, srs, table, tagseq.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/ReportFormats.html for further
   information on report formats.

   By default patmatmotifs writes a 'dbmotif' report file.

#
# Visual pigments [1,2] are the light-absorbing  molecules that  mediate vision.
# They consist of  an apoprotein, opsin,  covalently  linked  to the chromophore
# cis-retinal.  Vision is  effected through  the absorption of a  photon by cis-
# retinal  which is isomerized to  trans-retinal.  This isomerization leads to a
# change  of conformation  of the protein. Opsins are integral membrane proteins
# with  seven transmembrane regions that belong to family 1 of G-protein coupled
# receptors (see <PDOC00210>).
#
# In vertebrates four different pigments are generally found.   Rod cells, which
# mediate vision in dim light, contain the pigment rhodopsin.  Cone cells, which
# function in bright light, are responsible  for  color vision and contain three
# or more color pigments (for example, in mammals: red, blue and green).
#
# In Drosophila, the  eye   is composed   of 800   facets  or   ommatidia.  Each
# ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-R8):  the R1 to R6 cells are
# outer cells,  R7  and R8 inner cells. Each of the three types of cells (R1-R6,
# R7 and R8) expresses a specific opsin.
#
# Proteins evolutionary related to opsins include squid retinochrome, also known
# as retinal  photoisomerase, which converts various isomers of retinal into 11-
# cis retinal and mammalian retinal pigment  epithelium (RPE) RGR [3], a protein
# that may also act in retinal isomerization.
#
# The attachment  site  for  retinal in the above proteins is a conserved lysine
# residue in  the  middle  of  the  seventh  transmembrane helix. The pattern we
# developed includes this residue.

   Data and documentation from PROSITE files is automatically read. This
