Function

   Calculate the composition of unique words in sequences

Description

   compseq calculates the composition of words of a specified length
   (dimer, trimer etc) in the input sequence(s). The word length is
   user-specified. The unique sequences (words), their observed count,
   observed frequency, expected frequency and (observed / expected)
   frequency are written to the output file. The (observed / expected)
   frequency highlights any words with unusually high (or low) occurence
   in the input sequences.

Algorithm

   By default, compseq makes the (false) assumption that each word is
   equally likely. The expected frequency therefore of any dimer is 1/16
   - this is simply the inverse of the number of possible dimers (AA, AC,
   AG, AT, CA, CC, CG, CT, GA, GC, GG, GT, TA, TC, TG, TT). Similarly,
   the expected frequency of any trimer is 1/64, etc. Clearly this is not
   the case in real sequences where there will be bias in favour of some
   monomers and words. There are ways around this (see "Notes").

   The normal behaviour of compseq is to count the frequencies of all
   words that occur by moving a window of length 'word' up by one each
   time. The '-frame' option allows you to move the window up by the
   length of the word each time, skipping over the intervening words. You
   can count only those words that occur in a single frame of the word by
   setting this value to a number other than zero. If you set it to 1 it
   will only count the words in frame 1, 2 will only count the words in
   frame 2 and so on.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with compseq

   To count the frequencies of dinucleotides in a file:


% compseq tembl:x65923 -word 2 result3.comp 
Calculate the composition of unique words in sequences

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   To count the frequencies of hexanucleotides, without outputting the
   results of hexanucleotides that do not occur in the sequence:


% compseq tembl:x65923 -word 6 result6.comp -nozero 
Calculate the composition of unique words in sequences

   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 3

   To count the frequencies of trinucleotides in frame 2 of a sequence
   and use a previously prepared compseq output to show the expected
   frequencies:


% compseq tembl:x65923 -word 3 result3.comp -frame 2 -in prev.comp 
Calculate the composition of unique words in sequences

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence(s) filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
   -word               integer    [2] This is the size of word (n-mer) to
                                  count.
                                  Thus if you want to count codon frequencies
                                  for a nucleotide sequence, you should enter
                                  3 here. (Integer 1 or more)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.compseq] This is the results file.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -infile             infile     This is a file previously produced by
                                  'compseq' that can be used to set the
                                  expected frequencies of words in this
                                  analysis.
                                  The word size in the current run must be the
                                  same as the one in this results file.
                                  Obviously, you should use a file produced
                                  from protein sequences if you are counting
                                  protein sequence word frequencies, and you
                                  must use one made from nucleotide
                                  frequencies if you are analysing a
                                  nucleotide sequence.
   -frame              integer    [0] The normal behaviour of 'compseq' is to
                                  count the frequencies of all words that
                                  occur by moving a window of length 'word' up
                                  by one each time.
                                  This option allows you to move the window up
                                  by the length of the word each time,
                                  skipping over the intervening words.
                                  You can count only those words that occur in
                                  a single frame of the word by setting this
                                  value to a number other than zero.
                                  If you set it to 1 it will only count the
                                  words in frame 1, 2 will only count the
                                  words in frame 2 and so on. (Integer 0 or
                                  more)
*  -[no]ignorebz       boolean    [Y] The amino acid code B represents
                                  Asparagine or Aspartic acid and the code Z
                                  represents Glutamine or Glutamic acid.
                                  These are not commonly used codes and you
                                  may wish not to count words containing them,
                                  just noting them in the count of 'Other'
                                  words.
*  -reverse            boolean    [N] Set this to be true if you also wish to
                                  also count words in the reverse complement
                                  of a nucleic sequence.
   -calcfreq           boolean    [N] If this is set true then the expected
                                  frequencies of words are calculated from the
                                  observed frequency of single bases or
                                  residues in the sequences.
                                  If you are reporting a word size of 1
                                  (single bases or residues) then there is no
                                  point in using this option because the
                                  calculated expected frequency will be equal
                                  to the observed frequency.
                                  Calculating the expected frequencies like
                                  this will give an approximation of the
                                  expected frequencies that you might get by
                                  using an input file of frequencies produced
                                  by a previous run of this program. If an
                                  input file of expected word frequencies has
                                  been specified then the values from that
                                  file will be used instead of this
                                  calculation of expected frequency from the
                                  sequence, even if 'calcfreq' is set to be
                                  true.
   -[no]zerocount      boolean    [Y] You can make the output results file
                                  much smaller if you do not display the words
                                  with a zero count.

Input file format

   compseq reads a normal sequence(s) USA.

   An optional second input file is the output from a previous compseq
   run used to set the expected word frequencies.

   The optional second input data file format is exactly the same as the
   output file format.

   It expects to read in a previous output file of this program. An error
   is produced if the word size of the current compseq job and that of
   the output file being read in are different.

Output file format

   The output format consists of:

   Header information and comments are preceeded by a '#' character at
   the start of the line.

   The Word size and the Total count are then given on separate lines,

   The headers of the columns of results are preceeded by a '#'

   The results columns are: the sub-sequence word, the observed
   frequency, the expected frequency (which will be read from the input
   file if one is given, else it is a simple inverse of the number of
   words of the size specified that can be constructed), the ratio of the
   observed to expected frequency.

   After a blank line at the end, the results of 'Other' words is given -
   this is the number of words with a sequence which has IUPAC ambiguity
   codes or other unusual characters in.

Notes

   The maximum word size is limited to 4 for proteins, and 6 for
   nucleotide sequences.

   Large word sizes are not appropriate for the compseq algorithm. All
   possible words will be stored and reported. The algorithm is designed
   to generate useful information for word sizes expected to occur at
   least once in the input sequence.

   The results are held in an array in memory before being written to a
   file. For large values of wordsize (over about 7 for nucleic, 5 for
   protein), you may run out of memory or generate a very large output
   file.

   There is no way for compseq to guess what the true expected frequency
   should be for each word. It can however read in the result of a
   previous compseq analysis and use this to set the expected frequencies
   of the subsequences. In this case, the input sequences under
   investigation should be representative of those used for the previous
   compseq analysis. It is down to your biological expertise to ensure
   the sequences are genuinely "representative", for instance, you might
   select a group of sequences belonging to the same taxonomic rank such
   as genus or species.

   The file of expected frequencies is specified by name with the -infile
   qualifier. The word size in the current run must be the same as the
   one in this results file. Obviously, you should use a file produced
   from protein sequences if you are counting protein sequence word
   frequencies, and you must use one made from nucleotide frequencies if
   you are analysing a nucleotide sequence.

   As an alternative to using -infile, the expected frequencies of words
   may be calculated from the observed frequency of single bases or
   residues in the sequences. To do this, specify the -calcfreq
   qualifier. If you are reporting a word size of 1 (single bases or
   residues) then there is no point in using this option because the
   calculated expected frequency will be equal to the observed frequency.

   Calculating the expected frequencies like this will give an
   approximation of the expected frequencies that you might get by using
   an input file of frequencies produced by a previous run of this
   program. If an input file of expected word frequencies has been
   specified then the values from that file will be used instead of this
   calculation of expected frequency from the sequence, even if
   'calcfreq' is set to be true.

Warnings

Diagnostic Error Messages

   "The word size is too large for the data structure available."
          You chose a word size that cannot be stored by the program.

   "Insufficient memory - aborting."
          You do not have enough memory - use a machine with more memory.

   "The word size you are counting (n) is different to the word size in
          the file of expected frequencies (n)."
          You chose different word sizes in the run of compseq that
          produced your results file used to display the expected word
          frequencies to the word size used in this run of compseq.

   "The 'Word size' line was not found, instead found:"
          You appear to be trying to read a corrupted compseq results
          file

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0 unless one of the above error conditions
   is found

Known bugs

   This program can use a large amount of memory is you were allowed to
   specify a large word size (7 or above). This may impact the behaviour
   of other programs on your machine.

   If you run out of memory, you may see the program crash with a generic
   error message that will be specific to your machine's operating
   system, but will probably be a warning about writing to memory that
   the program does not own (eg "Segmentation fault" on a Solaris
   machine)

   This is not a bug, it is a feature of the way this program grabs large
   amounts of memory. The maximum word size is restricted to avoid this
   problem.

History

   Completed 2 March 2000
   5 April 2001 (version 1.12.0) - the operation of the option '-reverse'
   has changed. It is now 'False' by default instead of being 'True' by
   default for nucleic sequences. Too many people were getting confused
   by the counts being done on both senses, so this is now done on only
   the forward sense by default.

Target users

   This program is intended to be used by everyone and everything, from
   naive users to embedded scripts.
