Function

   Display the trace in an ABI sequencer file

Description

   abiview reads in an ABI sequencer trace file and graphically displays
   the data. The probabilities of each of the 4 nucleotide bases along the
   sequencing run is plotted and the assigned nucleotide (G, A, T, C or N)
   from the ABI file is overlayed on the graphs. The complete sequence is
   written to an output file.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with abiview


% abiview -graph cps
Display the trace in an ABI sequencer file

  Graphics File: abiview.ps

   [abiview results]

   The horizontal scale of the output image labelled 'Residue Position' is
   only a very approximate indication of the spacing of residues in the
   image. The real residue spacing is variable, as it relies on the speed
   with which the oligo-nucleotides are eluted in the ABI sequencer. Do
   not be surprised to see the nucleotide signals spaced at a much greater
   distance than the horizontal scale might suggest.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   An ABI file (*.abi) contains sequence trace data and base calls from a
   run of an ABI nucleotide sequencer machine. A trace data file is what
   you get back from having some DNA sequenced, for example, by a 3730XL
   sequencer. The files are in "binary" format and so cannot be viewed
   directly on screen. To inspect the sequencing data you must use a trace
   viewer such as abiview. Another good trace viewer is FinchTV
   (http://www.geospiza.com/finchtv/). It is a stand-alone program and is
   freely available.
