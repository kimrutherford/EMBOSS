Function

   Finds PEST motifs as potential proteolytic cleavage sites

Description

   epestfind rapidly and objectively identifies PEST motifs in an input
   protein sequence. PEST motifs reduce the half-lives of proteins
   dramatically and hence, that they target proteins for proteolytic
   degradation. epestfind writes an output file with putative PEST motifs
   and (optionally) the PEST scores are plotted for the whole sequence
   length.

   The epestfind output file includes poor and potential PEST motifs
   together with their PEST score, mass percent of DEPST and their
   hydrophobicity index. 'Valid' PEST motifs below the specified
   threshold score are considered as 'poor', while PEST scores above the
   threshold score are of real biological interest. The higher the PEST
   score, the more likely is degradation of proteins mediated via
   'potential' PEST motifs in eukaryotic cells.

Algorithm

   PEST motifs were defined as hydrophilic stretches of at least 12 amino
   acids length with a high local concentration of critical amino acids.
   Remarkably, negatively charged amino acids are clustered within these
   motifs while positively charged amino acids, arginine (R), histidine
   (H) and lysine (K) are generally forbidden.

   The epestfind algorithm defines the last criterion even more
   stringently in that PEST motifs are required to be flanked by
   positively charged amino acids. Though this implication greatly
   facilitates computer scanning, a few PEST sequences might be missed.
   Especially sequences with a high local concentration of critical amino
   acids but with a long distance between positively charged amino acids
   are error prone. Due to their length, these PEST motifs might become
   diluted, which results in scores apparently lower than initially
   expected. Another side effect of scanning for positively charged amino
   acids is that very long PEST motifs are sub-divided into adjacent
   smaller ones. However, identification of PEST motifs is achieved by an
   initial scan for positively charged amino acids arginine (R),
   histidine (H) and lysine (K) within the specified protein sequence.
   All amino acids between the positively charged flanks are counted and
   only those motifs are considered further, which contain a number of
   amino acids equal to or higher than the window-size parameter.
   Additionally, all 'valid' PEST regions are required to contain at
   least one proline (P), one aspartate (D) or glutamate (E) and at least
   one serine (S) or threonine(T). Sequences that do not meet the above
   criteria are classified as 'invalid' PEST motifs and excluded from
   further analysis.

   The quality of 'valid' PEST motifs is refined by means of a scoring
   parameter based on the local enrichment of critical amino acids as
   well as the motif's hydrophobicity. Enrichment of D, E, P, S and T is
   expressed in mass percent (w/w) and corrected for one equivalent of D
   or E, one of P and one of S or T. Calculation of hydrophobicity
   follows in principle the method of J. Kyte and R.F. Doolittle [4]. For
   simplified calculations, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy indices, which
   originally ranged from -4.5 for arginine to +4.5 for isoleucine, were
   converted to positive integers. This was achieved by the following
   linear transformation, which yielded values from 0 for arginine to 90
   for isoleucine.

        Hydropathy index = 10 * Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index + 45

   The motif's hydrophobicity is calculated as the sum over the products
   of mole percent and hydrophobicity index for each amino acid species.
   The desired PEST score is obtained as combination of local enrichment
   term and hydrophobicity term as expressed by the following equation:

          PEST score = 0.55 * DEPST - 0.5 * hydrophobicity index.

   Although, the formula above differs from the publication [1], it is in
   fact the correct one, which was also implemented in the original BASIC
   programme (personal communication). In addition, the programme
   includes a correction for the hydropathy index of tyrosine, introduced
   by Robert H. Stellwagen from the University of Southern California.
   However, PEST scores can range from -45 for poly-isoleucine to about
   +50 for poly-aspartate plus one proline and one serine. 'Valid' PEST
   motifs below the threshold score (5.0) are considered as 'poor', while
   PEST scores above the threshold score are of real biological interest.
   The higher the PEST score, the more likely is degradation of proteins
   mediated via 'potential' PEST motifs in eukaryotic cells.

   Presently, all modified Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy indices are
   hard-coded into the programme, which might change in future.

   The array of linear transformed Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy indices
   (ltkdhi) is listed in alphabetical order below. (A-M and N-Z as well
   as N-terminus and C-terminus)

   63, 10, 70, 10, 10, 72, 41, 13, 90, 0, 6, 82, 64, 10, 0, 29, 10, 0,
   36, 38, 0, 87, 36, 45, 58, 10, 0, 0

   The linear transformation was ltkdhi = 10 * kdhi + 45
   All values range from Argine R = 0 to Isoleucine I = 90
   B=(N|D)=10 since N=10 and D=10
   Z=(Q|E)=10 since Q=10 and E=10
   X=10*0+45=45

   [epestfind results]

   The output from epestfind is a simple text one. It reports poor and
   potential PEST motifs together with their PEST score, mass percent of
   DEPST and their hydrophobicity index.

   'Valid' PEST motifs below the threshold score (5.0) are considered as
   'poor', while PEST scores above the threshold score are of real
   biological interest. The higher the PEST score, the more likely is
   degradation of proteins mediated via 'potential' PEST motifs in
   eukaryotic cells.

Data files

   The physico-chemical properties of the residues are read from the
   EMBOSS data file 'Eamino.dat'. This file can be copied into your
   current directory and inspected or altered by using the application
   'embossdata -fetch'. Another file can be specified using the qualifier
   '-aadata'.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   Briefly, the PEST hypothesis was based on a literature survey that
   combined both information on protein stability as well as protein
   primary sequence information. Initially, the study relied on 12
   short-lived proteins with well-known properties [1], but was
   continually extended later [2,3]. The initial group of proteins
   included E1A, c-myc, p53, c-fos, v-myb, P730 phytochrome, heat shock
   protein 70 (HSP 70), HMG-CoA reductase, tyrosine aminotransferase
   (TAT), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), alpha-Casein and beta-Casein.
   Although all these proteins exerted various different cellular
   functions it became apparent that they shared high local
   concentrations of amino acids proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine
   (S), threonine (T) and to a lesser extent aspartic acid (D). From that
   it was concluded that PEST motifs reduce the half-lives of proteins
   dramatically and hence, that they target proteins for proteolytic
   degradation.

   PEST means Black Death in German, so that the name of this programme
   sounds a bit strange, at least in our ears.
