Function

   Type in a short new sequence

Description

   This allows you to type a sequence into a file in a quick and easy
   manner.

   The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a fairly
   short length (typically less than 255 characters). This length
   restriction is not a property of the EMBOSS package, but of the
   computer system you are using. This is because, as you type in
   response to a prompt from this program, what you type is stored in the
   computer operating system before being handed over to the program.
   There is often a limit of less than 255 characters on the length of a
   response that a computer system will allow you to give.

   Despite this restriction, it is expected that this program will be a
   useful and easy way of constructing new sequence files.

   (You wouldn't want to type a long sequence in by hand, anyway, would
   you?)

Usage

   Here is a sample session with newseq

   Type in a short sequence to the file 'mycc.pep' in SWISSPROT format:


% newseq 
Type in a short new sequence.
Name of the sequence: cytoc
Description of the sequence: fragment of cytochrome c
Type of sequence
         N : Nucleic
         P : Protein
Type of sequence [N]: p
Enter the sequence: KKKEERADLIAY
output sequence [outfile.fasta]: swiss::mycc.pep

   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-name]              string     The name of of the sequence should be a
                                  single word that you will use to identify
                                  the sequence. It should have no (or few)
                                  punctuation characters in it. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
  [-description]       string     Enter any description of the sequence that
                                  you require. (Any string is accepted)
  [-type]              menu       [N] Type of sequence (Values: N (Nucleic); P
                                  (Protein))
  [-sequence]          string     The sequence itself.
                                  Because of the limitation of the operating
                                  system, you will only be able to type in a
                                  short sequence of (typically) 250
                                  characters, or so.
                                  The keyboard will beep at you when you have
                                  reached this limit and you will not be able
                                  to press the RETURN/ENTER key until you have
                                  deleted a few characters. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
  [-outseq]            seqout     [.] Sequence filename and
                                  optional format (output USA)

Notes

   The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a fairly
   short length (typically less than 255 characters). If your computer
   beeps at you, you will typically have to delete the last character you
   typed and press the RETURN key.
