Function

   Removes vectors from the ends of nucleotide sequence(s)

Description

   vectorstrip reads one or more nucleotide sequences and writes them out
   again but with any of a specified set of vector sequences removed from
   the 5' and 3' termini. An output file with a summary of the results is
   also written. The vector sequences to strip out are (typically)
   provided in an input file. The pair of 5' and 3' vector sequences are
   searched against each input sequence allowing a specified maximum level
   of mismatches. Each 5' hit is paired with each 3' hit and the resulting
   subsequences output. By default only the best match between the vector
   patterns and each sequence are reported. Optionally, all matches up to
   the specified maximum mismatch level are reported.

Input file format

# Example vector file for use by vectorstrip

   The same fragment has been cloned into the XhoI site of the polylinker
   of each vector. The cloned fragment is represented in lower case and
   the vector sequence in upper case so the sequence trimming can be
   readily seen.

   Each line of the vector file should contain the name of the vector, the
   5' pattern and the 3' pattern.
   Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and ignored.
   If only one vector sequence is given in the it will be assumed that
   this is the 5' pattern.
   If a vector name is given but no pattern data, the vector will not be
   used.

   Two types of output file are produced:
    1. The sequence file(s) - contain the trimmed subsequence(s) produced
       by vectorstrip either all in one file, or in separate files if the
       command line flag -ossingle is used.
    2. Results summary file

Data files

   None.

Notes

   vectorstrip is intended for stripping vector sequence from the ends of
   sequences of interest. For example, if a fragment has been cloned into
   a vector and then sequenced, the sequence may contain vector data eg
   from the cloning polylinker at the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence.
   vectorstrip will remove these contaminating regions and output trimmed
   sequence ready for input into another application.

   vectorstrip is suitable for use with low quality sequence data as it
   can allow for mismatches between the sequence and the vector patterns
   provided. You can specify the maximum level of mismatch expected.

   Vector data can either be provided in a file or interactively. If
   presented in a file, vectorstrip will search all input sequences with
   all vectors listed in that file. The intention is that the user can
   maintain a single file for use with vectorstrip, containing all the
   linker sequences commonly used in the laboratory.

   The two patterns for each vector are searched separately against the
   sequence. Once the search is completed, each of the hits of the 5'
   sequence is paired with each of the hits of the 3' sequence and the
   resulting subsequences are output. For example, if the 5' sequence
   matches the sequence from (a) position 30-60, and(b)position 70-100,
   and the 3' sequence matches from 150-175, then two subsequences will be
   output: from 61-149, and from 101-149. The lower the quality of the
   sequence, the more likely multiple hits become if nonzero mismatches
   are accepted.

   Default behaviour is to report only the best matches between the vector
   patterns and the sequence. This means that if you specify a maximum
   mismatch level of 10%, but the vector patterns match the sequence with
   zero mismatches, the search will stop and the program will output only
   these "best" matches. If there are no perfect matches, the program will
   try searching again allowing 1 mismatch, then 2, and so on until either
   the patterns match the sequence or the maximum specified mismatch level
   is exceeded. You can tell vectorstrip to show all possible matches up
   to your specified maximum level, as illustrated in the examples below.

Diagnostic Error Messages

    1.
No suitable vectors found - exiting
       indicates that the 5' and 3' patterns for the vectors were blank -
       usually this is as a result of an empty vectorfile.
    2.
Illegal pattern
       indicates that one of the vector patterns could not be compiled and
       therefore cannot be searched.
    3.
5' and 3' sequence matches are identical; inconclusive
       indicates that the 5' and 3' patterns provided were identical, and
       that they only match the sequence once. Thus the program cannot
       determine which part of the sequence is vector and which is insert.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
