Function

   Finds neighbouring pairs of features in sequence(s)

Description

   twofeat finds neighbouring pairs of specified features in one or more
   input sequences. Each feature may be specified by type, name, sense,
   score, tag/value pairs etc. Their relationship, e.g. their sequence
   separation or overlap, relative sense and order may also be specified.
   It writes a standard EMBOSS report file with any such feature pairs
   identified. By default each pair is written as a single feature but
   (optionally) they are written in their original form.

Algorithm

   For each of the pair of features, you can specify its type name, its
   sense, its score and any tag/value pairs, amongst other things.

   You can then specify the type of relationship that the two features
   should have as follows:

   Minimum and maximum distance between each feature.

   Distance measurement (measure from the nearest ends of the two
   features, from the left ends, from right ends, from the furthest ends.)

   Type of overlap (any type of overlap or no overlap is allowed, Overlap
   required, No overlaps are allowed, Overlap required but one feature
   must not be completely within the other, Feature A must be completely
   enclosed within feature B, Feature B must be completely enclosed within
   feature A).

   Feature sense (any sense, in the same sense or in opposite senses)

   Feature order (any order, Feature A then feature B, Feature B then
   feature A)

   The program proceeds as follows. For eachs sequence: Identify the
   features that match the criteria for Feature A Identify the features
   that match the criteria for Feature B Compare all pairs of features If
   they satisfy the requirements output them to the report file

   By default the resulting pairs of features found are then written to a
   report file as a single feature from the first postion of the left-most
   feature to the last position of the right-most feature. You can modify
   the output to report the pairs of features with no changes made to
   them.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with twofeat

   Without the -twoout option the output report contains just one feature
   for every pair of features found.


% twofeat tembl:x65923
Finds neighbouring pairs of features in sequence(s)
Type of first feature [*]: polyA_signal
Type of second feature [*]: polyA_site
The minimum distance between the features [0]: 10
The maximum distance between the features [0]: 50
Output report [x65923.twofeat]:

   Example 2

   The -twoout option makes the output report give the pairs of features
   found. The output report format type has been changed to display the
   full original pairs of features in GFF format.


% twofeat -twoout -rformat gff tembl:x65923
Finds neighbouring pairs of features in sequence(s)
Type of first feature [*]: polyA_signal
Type of second feature [*]: polyA_site
The minimum distance between the features [0]: 10
The maximum distance between the features [0]: 50

                                  The source name is usually either the name

                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.
                                  If you wish to allow more than one tag
                                  value, separate their names with the
                                  character '|', eg:
                                  pax* | 10 (Any string)
   -overlap            menu       [A] This allows you to specify the allowed
                                  overlaps of the features A and B.
                                  You can allow any or no overlaps, specify
                                  that they must or must not overlap, that one
                                  must or must not be wholly enclosed within
                                  another feature. (Values: A (Any); O
                                  (Overlap required); NO (No overlaps are
                                  allowed); NW (Overlap required but not
                                  within); AW (A must be all within B); BW (B
                                  must be all within A))
   -rangetype          menu       [N] This allows you to specify the positions
                                  from which the allowed minimum or maximum
                                  distance between the features is measured
                                  (Values: N (From nearest ends); L (From left
                                  ends); R (From right ends); F (From
                                  furthest ends))
   -sense              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  sense that the two features must be on. This
                                  is ignored (always 'Any') when looking at
                                  protein sequence features. (Values: A (Any
                                  sense); S (Same sense); O (Opposite sense))
   -order              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  order of the two features. The order is
                                  measured from the start positions of the
                                  features. This criterion is always applied
                                  despite the specified overlap type required.
                                  (Values: A (Any); AB (Feature A then
                                  feature B); BA (Feature B then feature A))
   -twoout             toggle     [N] If you set this to be true, then the two
                                  features themselves will be written out. If
                                  it is left as false, then a single feature
                                  will be written out covering the two
                                  features you found.
*  -typeout            string     [misc_feature] If you have specified that
                                  the pairs of features that are found should
                                  be reported as one feature in the ouput,
                                  then you can specify the 'type' name of the
                                  new feature here. By default every feature
                                  in the feature table is allowed. See
                                  http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/ for
                                  a list of the EMBL feature types and see
                                  Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in
                                  http://www.expasy.ch/txt/userman.txt for a
                                  list of the Swissprot feature types. If you
                                  specify an invalid feature type name, then
                                  the default name 'misc_feature' is used.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
   feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/ReportFormats.html for further
   information on report formats.

   twofeat outputs a report format file. The default format is table

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   There is a slight memory leak that must be fixed at some time. This
   does no affect the results.
