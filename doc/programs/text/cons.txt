Function

   Create a consensus sequence from a multiple alignment

Description

   cons calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence
   alignment. To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring
   matrix are used to calculate a score for each amino acid residue or
   nucleotide at each position in the alignment. The highest scoring
   residue goes into the consensus sequence if the score is higher than a
   user-specified "plurality" value, otherwise, there is no consensus at
   that position.

Algorithm

   To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring matrix are
   used to calculate a score at each position in the alignment as follows.
   The residue (or nucleotide) i in an alignment column, is compared to
   all other residues (j) in the same column. The score for i is the sum
   over all residues j (not i=j) of the score(ij)*weight(j), where
   score(ij) is taken from a nucleotide or protein scoring matrix (see
   -datafile qualifier) and the "weight(j)" is the weighting given to the
   sequence j, which is given in the alignment file.
   q

   The highest scoring type of residue is then found in the column. If the
   number of "positive matches" (see below) for this residue is greater
   than the "plurality value" (see below), then this residue is the
   consensus residue. Otherwise there is no consensus for that position
   and an 'n' (nucleotide sequence alignment) or an 'x' (protein sequence
   alignment) character is written to the consensus sequence.

   The positive matches for a residue i are calculated as being the sum of
   the corresponding sequence weights for all the residues that increase
   the score of residue i (i.e. that have a positive score). The
   "plurality" qualifier sets the cut-off for the number of positive
   matches (weighted) below which there is no consensus.

Command line arguments

Create a consensus sequence from a multiple alignment
Version: EMBOSS:6.6.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqset     File containing a sequence alignment.
  [-outseq]            seqout     [.] Sequence filename and
                                  optional format (output USA)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     [EBLOSUM62 for protein, EDNAFULL for DNA]
                                  This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
   -plurality          float      [Half the total sequence weighting] Set a
                                  cut-off for the number of positive matches
                                  below which there is no consensus. The
                                  default plurality is taken as half the total
                                  weight of all the sequences in the
                                  alignment. (Any numeric value)
   -identity           integer    [0] Provides the facility of setting the
                                  required number of identities at a site for
                                  it to give a consensus at that position.
                                  Therefore, if this is set to the number of
                                  sequences in the alignment only columns of
                                  identities contribute to the consensus.
                                  (Integer 0 or more)
   -setcase            float      [@( $(sequence.totweight) / 2)] Sets the
                                  threshold for the positive matches above
                                  which the consensus is is upper-case and
                                  below which the consensus is in lower-case.
                                  (Any numeric value)
   -name               string     Name of the consensus sequence (Any string)

Data files

   cons uses the standard set of scoring matrix data files in the EMBOSS
   data directory.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   The "identity" qualifier provides an additional constrain to
   "plurality" when determining a consensus residue at an alignment site.
   "identity" sets the required number of identities at a site for it to
   be included in the consensus. If for example this is set to the number
   of sequences in the alignment, then only a site with the same residue
   in all sequences would be included in the consensus.

   The "setcase" qualifier sets the threshold for the positive matches
   above which the consensus residue is given is upper-case and below
   which it is in lower-case.
