Function

   Extract features from sequence(s)

Description

   extractfeat is a simple utility for extracting regions of a sequence
   that are annotated as being a specified type of feature. It reads one
   or more sequences, and writes out the sequences and features of
   interest to an output sequence file. 'joined' features can either be
   extracted as individual sequences, or as a single concatenated sequence
   if the -join qualifier is used. If the feature is annotated as being in
   the reverse sense of a nucleic acid sequence, then that feature's
   sub-sequence is reverse-complemented before it is written.

   There are many options control exactly what parts of the feature table
   are given in the output file. In addition, it is often useful to have
   contextual information about a feature. There are options to specify a
   number of positions before and/or after the specified feature which
   will be reported in the output file.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with extractfeat

   To write out the exons of a sequence:


% extractfeat tembl:x65921 -type exon
Extract features from sequence(s)
output sequence [x65921.fasta]:

   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   To write out the exons with 10 extra bases at the start and end so that
   you can inspect the splice sites:


% extractfeat tembl:x65921 -type exon -before 10 -after 10
Extract features from sequence(s)
output sequence [x65921.fasta]:


   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 3

   To write out the 10 bases around the start of all 'exon' features in
   the tembl database:


% extractfeat "tembl:*"  -type exon -before 5 -after -5

Command line arguments

Extract features from sequence(s)
Version: EMBOSS:6.5.6.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence(s) filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-outseq]            seqout     [.] Sequence filename and
                                  optional format (output USA)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -before             integer    [0] If this value is greater than 0 then
                                  that number of bases or residues before the
                                  feature are included in the extracted
                                  sequence. This allows you to get the context
                                  of the feature. If this value is negative
                                  then the start of the extracted sequence
                                  will be this number of bases/residues before
                                  the end of the feature. So a value of '10'
                                  will start the extraction 10 bases/residues
                                  before the start of the sequence, and a
                                  value of '-10' will start the extraction 10
                                  bases/residues before the end of the
                                  feature. The output sequence will be padded
                                  with 'N' or 'X' characters if the sequence
                                  starts after the required start of the
                                  extraction. (Any integer value)
   -after              integer    [0] If this value is greater than 0 then
                                  that number of bases or residues after the
                                  feature are included in the extracted
                                  sequence. This allows you to get the context
                                  of the feature. If this value is negative
                                  then the end of the extracted sequence will
                                  be this number of bases/residues after the
                                  start of the feature. So a value of '10'
                                  will end the extraction 10 bases/residues
                                  after the end of the sequence, and a value
                                  of '-10' will end the extraction 10
                                  bases/residues after the start of the
                                  feature. The output sequence will be padded
                                  with 'N' or 'X' characters if the sequence
                                  ends before the required end of the
                                  extraction. (Any integer value)
   -source             string     [*] By default any feature source in the
                                  feature table is shown. You can set this to
                                  match any feature source you wish to show.
                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the
                                  feature came from.
                                  The source may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one source,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:
                                  gene* | embl (Any string)
   -type               string     [*] By default every feature in the feature
                                  table is extracted. You can set this to be
                                  any feature type you wish to extract.
                                  See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/WebFeat/ for a
                                  list of the EMBL feature types and see the
                                  Uniprot user manual in

                                  If you wish to extract more than one type,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:
                                  *UTR | intron (Any string)
   -sense              integer    [0 - any sense, 1 - forward sense, -1 -
                                  reverse sense] By default any feature type
                                  in the feature table is extracted. You can
                                  set this to match any feature sense you
                                  wish. 0 - any sense, 1 - forward sense, -1 -
                                  reverse sense (Any integer value)
   -minscore           float      [0.0] Minimum score of feature to extract
                                  (see also maxscore) (Any numeric value)
   -maxscore           float      [0.0] Maximum score of feature to extract.
                                  If both minscore and maxscore are zero (the
                                  default), then any score is ignored (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -tag                string     [*] Tags are the types of extra values that
                                  a feature may have. For example in the EMBL
                                  feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may
                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',
                                  '/db_xref', '/EC_number', '/evidence',
                                  '/exception', '/function', '/gene',
                                  '/label', '/map', '/note', '/number',
                                  '/partial', '/product', '/protein_id',
                                  '/pseudo', '/standard_name', '/translation',
                                  '/transl_except', '/transl_table', or
                                  '/usedin'. Some of these tags also have
                                  values, for example '/gene' can have the
                                  value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag in the feature
                                  table is extracted. You can set this to
                                  match any feature tag you wish to show.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to extract more than one tag,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:
                                  gene | label (Any string)
   -value              string     [*] Tag values are the values associated
                                  with a feature tag. Tags are the types of
                                  extra values that a feature may have. For
                                  example in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS'
                                  type of feature may have the tags '/codon',
                                  '/codon_start', '/db_xref', '/EC_number',
                                  '/evidence', '/exception', '/function',
                                  '/gene', '/label', '/map', '/note',
                                  '/number', '/partial', '/product',
                                  '/protein_id', '/pseudo', '/standard_name',
                                  '/translation', '/transl_except',
                                  '/transl_table', or '/usedin'. Only some of
                                  these tags can have values, for example
                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the
                                  feature table is shown. You can set this to
                                  match any feature tag value you wish to
                                  show.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag value,
                                  separate their names with a space or the
                                  character '|', eg:
                                  pax* | 10 (Any string)
   -join               boolean    [N] Some features, such as CDS (coding
                                  sequence) and mRNA are composed of introns
                                  concatenated together. There may be other
                                  forms of 'joined' sequence, depending on the
                                  feature table. If this option is set TRUE,
                                  then any group of these features will be
                                  output as a single sequence. If the 'before'
                                  and 'after' qualifiers have been set, then
                                  only the sequence before the first feature
                                  and after the last feature are added.
   -featinname         boolean    [N] To aid you in identifying the type of
                                  feature that has been output, the type of
                                  feature is added to the start of the
                                  description of the output sequence.
                                  Sometimes the description of a sequence is
                                  lost in subsequent processing of the
                                  sequences file, so it is useful for the type
                                  to be a part of the sequence ID name. If
                                  you set this to be TRUE then the name is
                                  added to the ID name of the output sequence.
   -describe           string     To aid you in identifying some further
                                  properties of a feature that has been
                                  output, this lets you specify one or more
                                  tag names that should be added to the output
                                  sequence Description text, together with
                                  their values (if any). For example, if this
                                  is set to be 'gene', then if any output
                                  feature has the tag (for example)
                                  '/gene=BRCA1' associated with it, then the
                                  text '(gene=BRCA1)' will be added to the
                                  Description line. Tags are the types of
                                  extra values that a feature may have. For
                                  example in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS'
                                  type of feature may have the tags '/codon',
                                  '/codon_start', '/db_xref', '/EC_number',
                                  '/evidence', '/exception', '/function',
                                  '/gene', '/label', '/map', '/note',
                                  '/number', '/partial', '/product',
                                  '/protein_id', '/pseudo', '/standard_name',
                                  '/translation', '/transl_except',
                                  '/transl_table', or '/usedin'. Some of these
                                  tags also have values, for example '/gene'
                                  can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default no feature tag is displayed. You
                                  can set this to match any feature tag you
                                  wish to show.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to extract more than one tag,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:
                                  gene | label (Any string)

   The sequences of the specified features are written out.

   The ID name of the sequence is formed from the original sequence name
   with the start and end positions of the feature appended to it. So if
   the feature came from a sequence with an ID name of 'XYZ' from
   positions 10 to 22, then the resulting ID name of the feature sequence
   will be 'XYZ_10_22'

   The name of the type of feature is added to the start of the
   description of the sequence in brackets, e.g.: '[exon]'.

   The sequence is written out as a normal sequence.

   If the feature is in the reverse sense of a nucleic acid sequence, then
   it is reverse-complemented before being written.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   Bear in mind that database annotation cannot always be trusted to be
   reliable. If you rely upon annotation written by other people or
   another program and do not independently verify such annotation, then
   there is a chance that some of the reported features will be erreneous.

  Controlling the output

   There are many options to control exactly what parts of the feature
   table are written to file.

   By default every feature in the feature table is extracted. -type will
   set the specific feature type to extract. See
   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/WebFeindex.html for a list of the EMBL
   feature types and see Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in
   http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence_annotation for a list of the
   Swissprot feature types.

   By default any feature tag in the feature table is extracted. -tag
   specifies a feature tag reuired in any feature extracted. Tags are the
   types of extra values that a feature may have. For example in the EMBL
   feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may have the tags /codon,
   /codon_start, /db_xref, /EC_number, /evidence, /exception, /function,
   /gene, /label, /map, /note, /number, /partial, /product,
   /protein_id,/pseudo, /standard_name, /translation, /transl_except,
   /transl_table, or /usedin. Some of these tags also have values, for
   example /gene can have the value of the gene name.

   By default any feature tag value in the feature table is shown. You can
   set this using -tag to match any specific feature tag value you wish to
   show. Tag values are the values associated with a feature tag, for
   example /gene can have the value of the gene name. Bear in mind only
   some of these tags can have values.

   By default any feature source in the feature table is shown. -source is
   used to set this to match a specific feature source.

   By default features in either sense are extracted. The -sense option
   specifies a particular sense.

   The minimum and maximum score of features to be reported may be
   specified with -minscore and -maxscore.

   To aid you in identifying the type of feature that has been output, the
   type of feature is added to the start of the description of the output
   sequence. Sometimes the description of a sequence is lost in subsequent
   processing of the sequences file, so it is useful for the type to be a
   part of the output sequence ID name. The -featinname option specifies
   this behaviour.

   To aid you in identifying the properties of a feature that has been
   output, -describe specifies one or more tag names that will be added to
   the output sequence "Description" text, together with their values (if
   any). For example, if this is set to be gene, then if any output
   feature has the tag (for example) /gene=BRCA1 associated with it, then
   the text (gene=BRCA1) will be added to the Description line. By default
   no feature tag is given in the "Description" text. You can set
   -describe to specify any feature tag you wish to show.

  "Joined" features

   Some features, such as CDS (coding sequence) and mRNA are composed of
   introns concatenated together. There may be other forms of 'joined'
   sequence, depending on the feature table. By default, 'joined' features
   are extracted as individual sequences. If the -join option is
   specified, then any group of these features will be output as a single
   sequence. If the -before and -after qualifiers have been set, then only
   the sequence before the first feature and after the last feature are
   added.

References

   None.

Warnings

Diagnostic Error Messages

   If the end position of the sequence to be written is less than the
   start position, then the warning message "Extraction region end less
   than start for feature type [start-end] in ID name" is written and no
   sequence is output.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
