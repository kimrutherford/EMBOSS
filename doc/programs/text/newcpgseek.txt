Function

   Identify and report CpG-rich regions in nucleotide sequence(s)

Description

   newcpgseek identifies in a nucleotide sequence regions with higher than
   expected frequency of the dinucleotide CG. Each position in the
   sequence is scored using a running sum calculated from all positions in
   the sequence. This is a different method to that typically used for
   identifying CpG islands, for example by newcpgreport and cpgplot. This
   method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around primary
   exons. An output file is written with information on the CpG-rich
   regions that are found. A feature table of sequence features in these
   regions is also written.

Algorithm

   newcpgseek scores each position in the sequence using a running sum
   calculated from all positions in the sequence, starting with the first
   and ending in the last. If there is not a CG dinucleotide at a
   position, the score is decremented, if there is one, the score is
   incremented by a constant (user-defined) value. If the score for a
   region in the sequence is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment)
   then a putative island is declared. Sequence regions scoring above the
   threshold are searched for recursively.

Input file format

   newcpgseek reads one or more nucleotide sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

Notes

   "CpG" refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases. Regions of
   genomic sequences rich in the CpG pattern or "CpG islands" are
   resistant to methylation and tend to be associated with genes which are
   frequently switched on. It's been estimated that about half of all
   mammalian genes, and, possibly all mammalian house-keeping genes, have
   a CpG-rich region around their 5' end. Non-mammalian vertebrates have
   some CpG islands that are associated with genes, but the association
   gets equivocal in the farther taxonomic groups. The detection of CpG
   island upstream of predicted exons or genes is evidence in support of a
   highly expressed gene.

   As there is no official definition of what is a CpG island is or how to
   identify where they begin and end, we work with two definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. cpgplot and newcpgreport use a sliding window within which the
   Observed/Expected ratio of CpG is calculated. For a sequence region to
   reported as a CpG island, it must satisfy the following contraints:
   Observed/Expected ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Sequence Length > 200

   2. newcpgseek and cpgreport use a running sum calculated from all
   positions in a sequence rather than a window to produce a score. If
   there is not a CG dinucleotide at a position, the score is decremented,
   if there is one, the score is incremented by a constant (user-defined)
   value. If the score for a region in the sequence is higher than a
   threshold (17 at the moment) then a putative island is declared.
   Sequence regions scoring above the threshold are searched for
   recursively.

   This method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around
   primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method as cpgreport but the
   output is different and more readable. For most purposes you should
   probably use newcpgreport rather than cpgreport. It is used to produce
   the human cpgisland database you can find on the EBI's ftp server as
   well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   newcpgseek and cpgreport both now display the actual CpG count, the (%C
   + %G) and the Observed/Expected ratio in the region where the score is
   above the threshold.

   The geecee program measures CG content in the entire input sequence and
   is not to be used to detect CpG islands. It can be useful for detecting
   sequences that MIGHT contain an island.
