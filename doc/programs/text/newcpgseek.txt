Function

   Identify and report CpG-rich regions in nucleotide sequence(s)

Description

   newcpgseek identifies in a nucleotide sequence regions with higher
   than expected frequency of the dinucleotide CG. Each position in the
   sequence is scored using a running sum calculated from all positions
   in the sequence. This is a different method to that typically used for
   identifying CpG islands, for example by newcpgreport and cpgplot. This
   method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around primary
   exons. An output file is written with information on the CpG-rich
   regions that are found. A feature table of sequence features in these
   regions is also written.

Algorithm

   newcpgseek scores each position in the sequence using a running sum
   calculated from all positions in the sequence, starting with the first
   and ending in the last. If there is not a CG dinucleotide at a
   position, the score is decremented, if there is one, the score is
   incremented by a constant (user-defined) value. If the score for a
   region in the sequence is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment)
   then a putative island is declared. Sequence regions scoring above the
   threshold are searched for recursively.

Notes

   "CpG" refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases. Regions of
   genomic sequences rich in the CpG pattern or "CpG islands" are
   resistant to methylation and tend to be associated with genes which
   are frequently switched on. It's been estimated that about half of all
   mammalian genes, and, possibly all mammalian house-keeping genes, have
   a CpG-rich region around their 5' end. Non-mammalian vertebrates have
   some CpG islands that are associated with genes, but the association
   gets equivocal in the farther taxonomic groups. The detection of CpG
   island upstream of predicted exons or genes is evidence in support of
   a highly expressed gene.

   As there is no official definition of what is a CpG island is or how
   to identify where they begin and end, we work with two definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. cpgplot and newcpgreport use a sliding window within which the
   Observed/Expected ratio of CpG is calculated. For a sequence region to
   reported as a CpG island, it must satisfy the following contraints:
   Observed/Expected ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Sequence Length > 200

   2. newcpgseek and cpgreport use a running sum calculated from all
   positions in a sequence rather than a window to produce a score. If
   there is not a CG dinucleotide at a position, the score is
   decremented, if there is one, the score is incremented by a constant
   (user-defined) value. If the score for a region in the sequence is
   higher than a threshold (17 at the moment) then a putative island is
   declared. Sequence regions scoring above the threshold are searched
   for recursively.

   This method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around
   primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method as cpgreport but the
   output is different and more readable. For most purposes you should
   probably use newcpgreport rather than cpgreport. It is used to produce
   the human cpgisland database you can find on the EBI's ftp server as
   well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   newcpgseek and cpgreport both now display the actual CpG count, the
   (%C + %G) and the Observed/Expected ratio in the region where the
   score is above the threshold.

   The geecee program measures CG content in the entire input sequence
   and is not to be used to detect CpG islands. It can be useful for
   detecting sequences that MIGHT contain an island.
