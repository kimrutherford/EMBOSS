Function

   Find differences between nearly identical sequences

Description

   diffseq takes two overlapping, nearly identical sequences and reports
   the differences between them, together with any features that overlap
   with these regions. GFF files of the differences in each sequence are
   also produced.

   diffseq finds the region of overlap of the input sequences and then
   reports differences within this region, like a local alignment.

   The start and end positions of the overlap are reported.

   diffseq should be of value when looking for SNPs, differences between
   strains of an organism and anything else that requires the differences
   between sequences to be highlighted.

   The sequences can be very long. The program does a match of all
   sequence words of size 10 (by default). It then reduces this to the
   minimum set of overlapping matches by sorting the matches in order of
   size (largest size first) and then for each such match it removes any
   smaller matches that overlap. The result is a set of the longest
   ungapped alignments between the two sequences that do not overlap with
   each other. The mismatched regions between these matches are reported.

   It should be possible to find differences between sequences that are
   Mega-bases long.

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-bsequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
   -wordsize           integer    [10] The similar regions between the two
                                  sequences are found by creating a hash table
                                  of 'wordsize'd subsequences. 10 is a
                                  reasonable default. Making this value larger
                                  (20?) may speed up the program slightly,
                                  but will mean that any two differences
                                  within 'wordsize' of each other will be
                                  grouped as a single region of difference.
                                  This value may be made smaller (4?) to
                                  improve the resolution of nearby
                                  differences, but the program will go much
                                  slower. (Integer 2 or more)
  [-outfile]           report     [*.diffseq] Output report file name
  [-aoutfeat]          featout    [$(asequence.name).diffgff] File for output
                                  of first sequence's features
  [-boutfeat]          featout    [$(bsequence.name).diffgff] File for output
                                  of second sequence's features

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -globaldifferences  boolean    [N] Normally this program will find regions
                                  of identity that are the length of the
                                  specified word-size or greater and will then
                                  report the regions of difference between
                                  these matching regions. This works well and
                                  is what most people want if they are working
                                  with long overlapping nucleic acid
                                  sequences. You are usually not interested in
                                  the non-overlapping ends of these
                                  sequences. If you have protein sequences or
                                  short RNA sequences however, you will be
                                  interested in differences at the very ends .
                                  It this option is set to be true then the
                                  differences at the ends will also be
                                  reported.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
   feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/ReportFormats.html for further
   information on report formats.

   By default diffseq writes a 'diffseq' report file.

   Each report consists of 4 or more lines.
     * The first line has the name of the first sequence followed by the
       start and end positions of the mismatched region in that sequence,
       followed by the length of the mismatched region. If the mismatched
       region is of zero length in this sequence, then only the position
       of the last matching base before the mismatch is given.
     * If a feature of the first sequence overlaps with this mismatch
       region, then one or more lines starting with 'Feature:' comes next
       with the type, position and tag field of the feature.
     * Next is a line starting "Sequence:" giving the sequence of the
       mismatch in the first sequence.

   This is followed by the equivalent information for the second
   sequence, but in the reverse order, namely 'Sequence:' line,
   'Feature:' lines and line giving the position of the mismatch in the
   second sequence.

   At the end of the report are two non-blank lines giving the positions
   in each sequence where the detected overlap between them ends.

   The last three lines of the report gives the counts of SNPs (defined
   as a change of one nucleotide to one other nucleotide, no deletions or
   insertions are counted, no multi-base changes are counted).

   If the input sequences are nucleic acid, The counts of transitions
   (Pyrimide to Pyrimidine or Purine to Purine) and transversions
   (Pyrimidine to Purine) are also given.

   It should be noted that not all features are reported.

   The 'source' feature found in all EMBL/Genbank feature table entries
   is not reported as this covers all of the sequence and so overlaps
   with any difference found in that sequence and so is uninformative and
   irritating. It has therefore been removed from the output report.

   The translation information of CDS features is often extremely long
   and does not add useful information to the report. It has therefore
   been removed from the output report.

   If you run out of memory, use a larger word size.

   Using a larger word size increases the length between mismatches that
   will be reported as one event. Thus a word size of 50 will report two
   single-base differences that are with 50 bases of each other as one
   mismatch.
