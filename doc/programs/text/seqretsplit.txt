Function

   Reads sequences and writes them to individual files

Description

   seqretsplit is a variant of the standard program for reading and
   writing sequences, seqret. It performs exactly the same function except
   that when it reads more than one sequence, it writes each sequence to
   an individual file. In all other respects, skipseq is the same as
   seqret. Its main use is therefore to split a file containing multiple
   sequences into many files, each containing one sequence. There are many
   options built-in into EMBOSS for detailed specification of the input
   and output sequences, for example the sequence type and file format.
   Optionally, feature information will be read and written.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with seqretsplit


% seqretsplit tembl:m1190*
Reads sequences and writes them to individual files
output sequence(s) [m11903.fasta]:


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   The specification of the output file is not used in this case.

   At some point this ought to change and you will not be prompted for the
   output file at all.

Input file format

   seqretsplit reads one or more nucleotide or protein sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

  Input files for usage example

   'tembl:m1190*' is a sequence entry in the example nucleic acid database
   'tembl'

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS sequence file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -osformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq,
   excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions, seqtable, simple, srs,
   table, tagseq.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

   One file for each input sequence is written out.

   The names of the files it creates are derived from the ID name of the
   sequence, followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence.
   You have no control over the names of the files it writes out.

   For example, if the files embl:hsfa11* are read in and the output is
   specified as wibble.seq, then the following files are expected to be
   created:

hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta

   (No file wibble.seq is created.)

Data files

   None.

Notes

   See the documentation for seqret to see the full range of things that
   you can do when reading and writing sequences.

   Some non-EMBOSS programs will accept only single sequences. In such
   cases seqretsplit is useful for splitting a multiple sequence file into
   many individual files. Some EMBOSS programs will also read only a
   single sequence, which may, however, be one of many in a file. You can
   specify the sequence using the USA filename:sequenceID. Nonetheless,
   some people feel more comfortable handling one sequence per file, so
   seqretsplit will be useful to them too.

   One file for each input sequence is written. The names of the files it
   creates are derived from the ID name of the sequence, followed by an
   extension denoting the format of the sequence. You have no control over
   the names of the files it writes out. For example, if the files
   embl:hsfa11* are read in and the output is specified as wibble.seq,
   then the following files are expected to be created:
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta

   (No file wibble.seq is created.)

References

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   It shouldn't really prompt for the output filename.

   This is a side effect of the way sequence output works in EMBOSS.
   Writing multiple sequences to separate files (the -ossingle qualifier)
   does this, and seqretsplit has set it automatically on.

Target users

   This program is intended to be used by everyone and everything, from
   naive users to embedded scripts.

Comments

   The specification of the output file is not used when the output file
   names are generated automatically..

   At some point this ought to change and you will not be prompted for the
   output file at all.
