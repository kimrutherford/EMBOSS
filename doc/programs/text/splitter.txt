Function

   Split sequence(s) into smaller sequences

Description

   splitter splits one or more input sequences into smaller, optionally
   overlapping, subsequences. The subsequence size and overlap (if any)
   may be specified. Optionally, feature information will be used.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with splitter

   Split a sequence into sub-sequences of 10,000 bases (the default size)
   with no overlap between the sub-sequences:


% splitter tembl:BA000025 ba000025.split
Split sequence(s) into smaller sequences


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   Split a sequence into sub-sequences of 50,000 bases with an overlap of
   3,000 bases on each sub-sequence:


% splitter tembl:BA000025 ba000025.split -size=50000 -over=3000
Split sequence(s) into smaller sequences

Notes

   Splitting a large sequence into smaller sub-sequences for analysis
   might be useful in cases where a particularly memory or CPU intensive
   application will not run quickly enough or at all on the full sequence.
   This should seldom be necessary in EMBOSS.

   By default, splitter will write all the sub-sequences to a single file.
   In some cases, particularly where non-EMBOSS programs are used, it is
   necessary to have a single sequence per file. To write the
   sub-sequences into separate files use the command-line switch
   -ossingle.
