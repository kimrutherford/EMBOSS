Function

   Removes gap characters from sequences

Description

   degapseq reads in one or more sequences and writes them out again
   minus any gap characters. In effect it removes gaps from aligned
   sequences.

   In fact, if does more than just this as it removes ANY non-alphabetic
   character from the input sequence, so as well as removing the
   gap-characters, it will remove such things as the '*' in protein
   sequences that indicates the position of a 'translated' STOP codon.

   There are many different formats for storing sequences in files. Some
   sequence formats allow you to store aligned sequences, including the
   information on where gaps have been introduced to make the sequence
   align properly. This is indicated by using a special character to
   indicate that there is a gap at that position. Different sequence
   formats use different characters to indicate gaps. Some formats may
   use more than one type of character to indicate different types of
   gaps (e.g. gaps at the ends of the sequences, internal gaps, gaps
   introduced by a program or by a person editing the alignment, etc.)
   Some typicate characters used to indicate where gaps are may be: '.',
   '-' and '~'.

   When EMBOSS programs read in a sequence that has gap-characters in,
   all gap characters are internally changed to '-' characters. i.e.
   EMBOSS only has one type of gap character. Thus any distinguishing
   characters for different gap types are reduced to a '-'. There is only
   one type of gap in EMBOSS.

   degapseq removes any non-alphabetic character in the sequence, in
   effect this means that gaps and '*' characters are removed. The
   sequence is then written out.
