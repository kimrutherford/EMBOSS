DS_1294                        Anopheles albimanus mRNAseq Martinez-Barnetche

Jesus Martinez-Barnetche and colleagues
(insert ref here) sequenced the
transcriptome of the Anopheles albimanus
adult female, an important malaria
vector in Latin America. By combining
Sanger, 454 and Illumina sequences from
cDNA libraries derived from the midgut,
cuticular fat body, dorsal vessel,
salivary gland and from whole adult
females, we generated a single,
high-quality assembly containing 16,669
transcripts, 92% of which mapped to the
An. darlingi genome. More than half of
the transcripts had a match to proteins
in other insect vectors and had an
InterPro annotation.

mosquito using LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD high

analyzed the mass spectrometry derived
data in Mascot search algorithm using
six frame translation of genome and
protein database of Anopheles, Aedes and
Drosophila. We identified novel genes,
corrected and validated gene annotations
of Anopheles gambiae.

Mouse_37; MGI_Representative_Transcripts track; MGI Representative Transcripts;
For all MGI gene and transcript tracks (i.e. not including ENSEMBL and NCBI gene
 models and the VEGA annotations) coordinates in the build 36 assembly were eith
er downloaded from UCSC (mrnas, ests, refseq NM and NRs) or BLATted locally (tig
r, DoTS, NIA, and refseq XM and XRs). Local BLAT results were filtered using psl
Reps -singleHit. These pools of coordinates were subsequently mined for relevant
 sequences based on various MGI database reports. Entries in the track are named
 using the GenBank sequence ID prepended to the MGI symbol. Each item in the tra
ck links to the corresponding MGI marker detail page.
DS_1595                        QTL

Mouse_37; QTL track; QTL; Quantitative trait loci were mapped to the build 36 as

flanks of the QTL. Each QTL entry in the track links to the corresponding MGI ma

er than the 1 Mbase GBrowse easily displays, the QTL track is also shown in a co
mpressed form in the overview panel.

Mouse_37; Adipose_tissue track; Adipose_tissue; Please see notes under MGI_Repre

e report, MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt, was parsed for markers and alleles that are
associated with transcripts (not including gene model transcripts) and the Top L
evel Mammalian Phenotype (MP) terms were captured. Note that these top level ter
ms can be associated with a marker multiple times (i.e. via multiple alleles). A
 track for each of the top-level MP terms, were then created. Within each track,
 the intron-exon structure of the transcript representing that marker has been p
reserved in the display. Track entries are named with a catenation of seqID, mar
ker symbol, and MP term. From the phenotypes tracks, each entry links to a page
that summarizes the phenotypic/allele details. The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
can be browsed here.

Mouse_37; GeneTraps_per_gene track; GeneTraps_per_Gene; Color-coded gene trap fr
equency track for MGI genes, indicating the number of gene trap insertions per g
ene. Only gene trap insertions that "trap" a gene (i.e., overlap the gene's coor
dinates in the correct transcriptional orientation) are counted.  If gene model
colored red there are >1000 gene traps associated with the gene, orange is 101 t
o 1000, green is 11 to 100, blue is 2 to 10, violet is just a single genetrap, a
nd black is no gene traps associated with the gene.
DS_1633                        GeneTraps_RNA_tags

Mouse_37; MGI_RNA_Gtraps track; GeneTraps_RNA_tags; Gene Trap sequence tags from
 GenBank dbGSS that have an RNA-based sequence tag method (5'-RACE or 3'-RACE).
 RNA-based gene trap sequence tags are derived from the exon adjacent to the ins
ertion site.  If the sequence tag method is 5'-RACE (blue), the insertion site i
s in the intron downstream from the most 3' exon represented in the sequence tag
.  If the sequence tag is 3'-RACE (green), the insertion site is in the intron u
pstream from the most 5' exon represented in the sequence tag.  Gene trap mutage
nesis requires that the vector inserts in the correct transcriptional orientatio
n of the "trapped" gene.  Sequence tags that overlap known genes in the opposite
 transcriptional orientation do not disrupt those genes from a gene trapping mec
hanism, and are not counted in the GeneTraps_per_Gene track.
