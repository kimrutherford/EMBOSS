Function

   Alter the name or description of a sequence

Description

   descseq reads a sequence and writes it to file but with a different
   name and / or description. All other records including the sequence
   itself are left unaltered.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with descseq

   Set the name of a sequence to "myclone23"


% descseq -seq dna.text -out clone23.seq -name "myclone23"
Alter the name or description of a sequence.


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   Set the description of a sequence to "This is my clone number 244"


% descseq -seq dna.text -out xy24.seq -desc "This is my clone number 244"
Alter the name or description of a sequence.


   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 3

   Append some text to the description of a sequence


% descseq -seq dna.text -out est4.seq -desc " (submitted)" -append
Alter the name or description of a sequence.

Input file format

   descseq reads a single nucleotide or protein sequence.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

  Input files for usage example

  File: dna.text

ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC
GTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT

Output file format

   descseq writes the sequence file with a changed name or description.

   The output is a standard EMBOSS sequence file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -osformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq,
   excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions, seqtable, simple, srs,
   table, tagseq.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

Notes

   Most sequence formats allow, at the very minimum, a name for the
   sequence and some comments to be stored in the sequence file. descseq
   let's you change the sequence name and / or description, and is far
   more convenient and less error-prone than using the editor for editing.

   The default action is to replace the existing name or description with
   your new one, but by using the qualifier -append what you enter is
   appended to the existing name or description. Note that if you append
   to a description, no space is inserted by default bewteen the existing
   description and your appended text. You have to put in a space yourself
   if you require one.

References

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
