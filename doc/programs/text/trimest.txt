Function

   Trim poly-A tails off EST sequences

Description

   EST and mRNA sequences often have poly-A tails at the end of them.
   This utility removes those poly-A tails.

   EST sequences are often the reverse complement of the corresponding
   mRNA's forward sense and have poly-T tails at their 5' end. By
   default, this program also detects and removes these and writes out
   the reverse complement of the sequence.

   trimest is not infallible. There are often repeats of 'A' (or 'T') in
   a sequence that just happen by chance to occur at the 3' (or 5') end
   of the EST sequence. trimest has no way of determining if the A's it
   finds are part of a real poly-A tail or are a part of the transcribed
   genomic sequence. It removes any apparent poly-A tails that match its
   criteria for a poly-A tail.

   trimest looks for a repeat of at least '-minlength' A's at the 3' end
   (and, by default, '-minlength' T's at the 5' end). If there are an
   apparent 5' poly-T tail and a poly-A tail, then it removes whichever
   is the longer of the two.

   By default, it will allow '-mismatches' non-A (or non-T) bases in the
   tail. If a mismatch is found, then there has to be at least
   '-minlength' A's (or T's) past the mismatch (working from the end) for
   the mismatch to be considered part of the tail. If '-mismatches' is
   greater than 1 then that number of contiguous non-A (or non-T) bases
   will be allowed as part of the tail.

   If a 5' poly-T tail is found, then the sequence will be optionally
   reverse-complemented when it is written out.

   If a poly-A tail is reomved then '[poly-A tail removed]' is appended
   to the description of the sequence. If poly-T is removed, then
   '[poly-T tail removed]' is appended and if the sequence is reversed,
   '[reverse complement]' is appended.

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  [.] Sequence set(s)
                                  filename and optional format (output USA)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -minlength          integer    [4] This is the minimum length that a poly-A
                                  (or poly-T) tail must have before it is
                                  removed. If there are mismatches in the tail
                                  than there must be at least this length of
                                  poly-A tail before the mismatch for the
                                  mismatch to be considered part of the tail.
                                  (Integer 1 or more)
   -mismatches         integer    [1] If there are this number or fewer
                                  contiguous non-A bases in a poly-A tail
                                  then, if there are '-minlength' 'A' bases
                                  before them, they will be considered part of
                                  the tail and removed .
                                  For example the terminal 4 A's of GCAGAAAA
                                  would be removed with the default values of
                                  -minlength=4 and -mismatches=1 (There are
                                  not at least 4 A's before the last 'G' and
                                  so only the A's after it are considered to
                                  be part of the tail). The terminal 9 bases
                                  of GCAAAAGAAAA would be removed; There are
                                  at least -minlength A's preceeding the last
                                  'G', so it is part of the tail. (Integer 0
                                  or more)
   -[no]reverse        boolean    [Y] When a poly-T region at the 5' end of
                                  the sequence is found and removed, it is
                                  likely that the sequence is in the reverse
                                  sense. This option will change the sequence
                                  to the forward sense when it is written out.
                                  If this option is not set, then the sense
                                  will not be changed.
   -tolower            toggle     [N] The poly-A region can be 'masked' by
                                  converting the sequence characters to
                                  lower-case. Some non-EMBOSS programs e.g.
                                  fasta can interpret this as a masked region.
                                  The sequence is unchanged apart from the
                                  case change. You might like to ensure that
                                  the whole sequence is in upper-case before
                                  masking the specified regions to lower-case
                                  by using the '-supper' sequence qualifier.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]fiveprime      boolean    [Y] If this is set true, then the 5' end of
                                  teh sequence is inspected for poly-T tails.
                                  These will be removed if they are longer
                                  than any 3' poly-A tails. If this is false,
                                  then the 5' end is ignored.

   The output is a set of sequences with the poly-A (or poly-T) tails
   removed. If a sequence had a 5' poly-T tail then the resulting
   sequence is reverse-complemented by default. The description line has
   a comment appended about the changes made to the sequence.
