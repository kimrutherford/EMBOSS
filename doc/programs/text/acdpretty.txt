Function

   Correctly reformat an application ACD file

Description

   acdpretty will generate a correctly, fully formatted ACD file from one
   which is parsable but which is partly or incorrectly formatted.

   acdpretty reads the ACD file and rewrites it with clean formatting to
   the file (ApplicationName).acdpretty which can be used to overwrite
   the original ACD file. The new file might contain many differences.
   For example, abbreviations will be expanded, all sections and
   attributes will be indented, all values will be quoted and lines will
   be wrapped at a reasonable width.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with acdpretty


% acdpretty qatest 

Created qatest.acdpretty

   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   The first parameter is the name of the program to pretty print.

   All other command line parameters and qualifiers are essentially
   ignored as processing stops once the ACD file is printed. A few of the
   general qualifiers have the potential to conflict with the function of
   acdpretty..

Input file format

   The input file is the ACD file for the specified program

Output file format

   The output file is a pretty printed copy of the original ACD file.

   All sections and attributed will be indented. All values will be
   quoted. Lines will be wrapped at a reasonable width.

   The output file is intended as a standard format for parsers used by
   GUI and other interface wrappers, rather than using the original ACD
   file directly.

Notes

   acdpretty does not have its own options, but takes a single parameter
   which is the name of the ACD file that is being processed. It is
   invoked by specifying the name of the ACD file after the name of the
   utility application itself:

   acdpretty ApplicationName

   Any command line parameters that would normally be specified for the
   application are essentially ignored as processing stops once the
   reformatted ACD file is printed.

   The format generated by acdpretty is intended as a standard for
   parsers used by GUI and other interface developers. It is far easier
   writing a parser to cope with acdpretty output than one which can cope
   with the ACD sytax in general.

Warnings

   A few of the global qualifiers have the potential to conflict with the
   function of acdpretty.
