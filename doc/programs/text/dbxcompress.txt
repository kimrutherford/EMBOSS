Function

   Compress an uncompressed dbx index

Description

   dbxcompress compressed EMBOSS B+tree format index files. By default,
   the indexing applications in EMBOSS compress all index files.

   Indexes modified by dbxuncompress and indexes prior to EMBOSS 6.4.0 are
   uncompressed.

Algorithm

   The B+tree index files contain discrete pages with a known maximum
   size, filled from the first byte with a count of index terms.

   dbxcompress reads all pages, calculating the free space at the end of
   each page, and then rewrite the pages to disk removing all free space.

   The final page is always written in full. This allows index reading to
   assume the maximum page size in all cases without reading beyond the
   end of file.

   Uncompressed index files are required for updating an existing index.
   Compressed index files provide more efficient storage and retrieval.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with dbxcompress


% dbxcompress embl -indexdir . -field des
Compress an uncompressed dbx index

Input file format

   dbxcompress reads the index files for a database created with an older
   version of one of the 'dbx' indexing programs, or uncompressed with
   dbxuncompress.

Output file format

   dbxcompress rewrites the index files in compressed form.
