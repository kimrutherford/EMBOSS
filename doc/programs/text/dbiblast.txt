Function

   Index a BLAST database

Description

   dbiblast indexes a blast database created by the NCBI indexing programs
   formatdb, pressdb or setdb, and builds EMBL CD-ROM format index files.
   This format is used by the software on the EMBL database CD-ROM
   distribution and by the Staden package in addition to EMBOSS, and
   appears to be the most generally used and publicly available index file
   format.

   The index files of the blast database format are not useful by
   themselves as they do not hold the entrynames or accession numbers, but
   they are used as pointers to the reference and sequence information in
   the database.

   Because there are two sequence types (nucleic acid and protein) and two
   index formats (blast1 from pressdb or setdb, and blast2 from formatdb)
   with different index file names, dbiblast will ask about the database
   type. If the answer is "unknown" dbiblast will test each possible set
   of file names until one is found.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with dbiblast

   This creates EMBOSS indices for the BLAST database 'swnew'


% dbiblast
Index a BLAST database
Database name: swnew
Database directory [.]: data
Wildcard database filename [swnew]:
Release number [0.0]:
Index date [00/00/00]:
         N : nucleic
         P : protein
         ? : unknown
Sequence type [unknown]:
         1 : wublast and setdb/pressdb
         2 : formatdb
         0 : unknown
Blast index version [unknown]:
General log output file [outfile.dbiblast]:

   dbiblast creates four index files. All are binary but with a simple
   format.
     * division.lkp is the master index file, and has a 300 byte header
       containing the database name and date plus information on the
       record size. This header is followed by one record for each
       database file, giving the full file name for the data file, and
       optionally a second sequence file.
     * entryname.idx is the entry name index. It has the same 300 byte
       header, mainly used to store the record size which will depend on
       the size of the longest entryname in the database. Each entry is
       stored in sorted alphanumeric order so that a binary search can be
       used to efficiently find any record. The record also holds the file
       number from division.lkp and the offsets in the data and sequence
       files for that entry.
     * acnum.trg holds the accession number information. The file has the
       usual 300 byte header, and a sorted list of record by accession
       number. Each accession number record contains the first record
       number in acnum.hit and the total number of records in acnum.hit so
       that secondary (duplicated) accession numbers can be searched.
     * acnum.hit is a very simple file. After the usual 300 byte header,
       each record simply holds the record number in entryname.idx. An
       accession number search will use acnum.trg to find a start position
       and number of records to read in this file, and will then simply
       read the entryname.idx records for each entry in turn.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   dbiblast can't use the new style of Blast indices. You must create the
   old style of Blast indices by adding -A F to the formatdb command line.

   Having created the EMBOSS indices for this file, a database can then be
   defined in the file emboss.defaults as something like:

DB swnew [
   type: P
   format: embl
   method: blast
   directory: /data/embl
]

  Fields Indexed

   By default, dbiblast will index the ID name and the accession number
   (if present).
   If they are present in your database, you may specify that dbiblast
   should index the Sequence Version and GI number and the words in the
   description by using the '-fields' qualifier with the appropriate
   values.

  Indexing the Blast database

   dbiblast can't use the new style of Blast indices. You must create the
   old style of Blast indices by adding -A F to the formatdb command line.

   The reason is that NCBI have not documented the new format, so we
   cannot extend dbiblast to read it.

   If you have the original (fasta format) file you can build the previous
   blast database format with:

   formatdb -A F

   This turns off the new "ASN.1" formatting. blastall will still work.

References

   None.

Warnings

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

Known bugs

   dbiblast can't use the new style of Blast indices. You must create the
   old style of Blast indices by adding -A F to the formatdb command line.
