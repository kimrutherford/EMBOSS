Function

   Extract regions from a sequence alignment

Description

   extractalign allows you to specify one or more regions of a sequence
   alignment to extract sub-sequences from to build up a resulting
   sub-sequence alignment. extractalign reads in a sequence alignment and
   a set of regions of that alignment as specified by pairs of start and
   end positions (either on the command-line or contained in a file) using
   gapped alignment positions as the coordinates, and writes out the
   specified regions of the input sequence in the order in which they have
   been specified. Thus, if the sequence "AAAGGGTTT" has been input and
   the regions: "7-9, 3-4" have been specified, then the output sequence
   will be: "TTTAG".

Usage

   Here is a sample session with extractalign

                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of

Input file format

   extractalign reads aligned nucleotide or protein sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

   You can specify a file of ranges to extract by giving the '-regions'
   qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file containing the
   ranges. (eg: '-regions @myfile').

   The format of the range file is:
     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.

   An example range file is:

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region


Output file format

   The output is a normal sequence file.

  Output files for usage example

  File: result.seq

>MSFM1
GTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC
>MSFM2
GTACGTACGT----ACGTAC
>MSFM3
GTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC

   If the option '-separate' is used then each specified region is written
   to the output file as a separate sequence. The name of the sequence is
   created from the name of the original sequence with the start and end
   positions of the range appended with underscore characters between
   them,

   For example: "XYZ region 2 to 34" is written as: "XYZ_2_34"

Data files

   None.

Notes

   None.

References

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   Several warning messages about malformed region specifications:
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * Unpaired start of a region found in ...
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
       end in ...

Exit status

   It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.

Known bugs

   None noted.
