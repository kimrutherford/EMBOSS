Function

   Extract regions from a sequence alignment

Description

   extractalign allows you to specify one or more regions of a sequence
   alignment to extract sub-sequences from to build up a resulting
   sub-sequence alignment. extractakign reads in a sequence alignment and
   a set of regions of that alignment as specified by pairs of start and
   end positions (either on the command-line or contained in a file)
   using gapped alignment positions as the coordinates, and writes out
   the specified regions of the input sequence in the order in which they
   have been specified. Thus, if the sequence "AAAGGGTTT" has been input
   and the regions: "7-9, 3-4" have been specified, then the output
   sequence will be: "TTTAG".

Usage

   Here is a sample session with extractalign

   Extract the region from position 10 to 20:


% extractalign dna.msf result.seq -regions '11-30'

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqset     (Aligned) sequence set filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -regions            range      [Whole sequence] Regions to extract.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45, 56-78

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to extract by giving the '-regions'
   qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file containing
   the ranges. (eg: '-regions @myfile').

   The format of the range file is:
     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.

   An example range file is:

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region

Output file format

   The output is a normal sequence file.

  Output files for usage example

  File: result.seq

>MSFM1
GTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC
>MSFM2
GTACGTACGT----ACGTAC
>MSFM3
GTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC

   If the option '-separate' is used then each specified region is
   written to the output file as a separate sequence. The name of the
   sequence is created from the name of the original sequence with the
   start and end positions of the range appended with underscore
   characters between them,

   For example: "XYZ region 2 to 34" is written as: "XYZ_2_34"

Diagnostic Error Messages

   Several warning messages about malformed region specifications:
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * Unpaired start of a region found in ...
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
       end in ...

Exit status

   It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.
