   appears in the input file. The output file name may be specified.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with nthseq


% nthseq
Write to file a single sequence from an input stream of sequences

Input file format

   nthseq reads a a normal sequence USA.

  Input files for usage example

  File: eclac.list

#Formerly ECLAC
tembl:J01636

#Formerly ECLACA
tembl:X51872

#Formerly ECLACI
tembl:V00294

#Formerly ECLACY
tembl:V00295

#Formerly ECLACZ

Output file format

   The output is the specified ordinal sequence from the input USA.

   In the example, the second sequence from the input file will be written
   out to the specified output file.

Notes

   In EMBOSS, when an application has to write out many sequences, they
   are typically all written to a single file. This default behaviour can
   be changed by using the qualifier -ossingle which forces each sequence
   to be written to its own file.

   The program seqretsplit will take a file containing many sequences and
   will output many files, each containing one sequence. However you have
   no choice over the naming of the files - they are named after the ID
   name fo the sequence they contain.

   It may be useful to use this application in a small script that
   extracts all sequences from a multiple sequence file and explicitly
   names the output files in the way that you require.

   For example:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
if ($#ARGV !=1) {
  die "Usage: scriptname in out\n";
}
$count=1;
@list = `infoseq $ARGV[0] -auto -only -name`;
while ($count <= $#list+1) {
  system("nthseq -auto $ARGV[0] -n $count $ARGV[1]-$count.seq");
  $count++;
}

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with a status of 0.

Known bugs

   None.
