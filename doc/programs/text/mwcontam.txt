Function

   Find weights common to multiple molecular weights files

Description

   mwcontam finds molecular weights that are common between a set of mass
   spectrometry result files at a specified ppm tolerance. Such molecular
   weights are usually a form of contamination resulting from autolysis of
   a protease, degradation of the matrix or presence of keratin from the
   sample preparer. The input is a comma-separated list of files each
   containing a list of experimental molecular weights. The output is a
   file with a list of the molecular weights common to all files.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with mwcontam


% mwcontam
Find weights common to multiple molecular weights files
Molecular weights file list: ../data/mw2.dat,mw3.dat
Ppm tolerance [50.0]:
Molecular weights output file [outfile.mwcontam]:


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

Input file format

  Input files for usage example

  File: mw1.dat

20.0
33.0
67.0
128.0
415.0
999.0

  File: mw2.dat

13.0
41.0
67.0
415.0
846.0
781.0

  File: mw3.dat

3.0
18.0
67.0
124.0
197.0
236.0
415.0
587.0
632.0

   The input is a comma-separated list of files containing simple list of
   experimental molecular weights.

   There should be one weight per line.

   Comments in the data file start with a '#' character in the first
   column.

   Blank lines are ignored.

Output file format

   The output is a list of the molecular weights common to all files.

  Output files for usage example

  File: outfile.mwcontam

67.000
415.000

Data files

   mwcontam uses no data files.

   The output of mwcontam, with minimal editing, can be added to the data
   file for the mwfilter program ('Emwfilter.dat'). For example you might
   like to fetch 'Emwfilter.dat' using embossdata (as described in the
   mwfilter documentation) and edit it to include the lines:
     __________________________________________________________________

# data produced from the program mwcontam
mwcontam        67.000
mwcontam        415.000

Notes

   The output of mwcontam, with minimal editing, can be added to the data
   file for the mwfilter program (Emwfilter.dat), which will then remove
   these weights from its input file of molecular weights. For example you
   might like to fetch Emwfilter.dat using embossdata (as described in the
   mwfilter documentation) and edit it to include the lines: # data
   produced from the program mwcontam mwcontam 67.000 mwcontam 415.000
