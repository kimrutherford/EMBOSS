Function

   Generate an HTML table of parameters from an application ACD file

Description

   acdtable is used to create the table of parameters, allowed values and
   defaults, used in the application documentation and to provide user
   help.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with acdtable


% acdtable antigenic 


 Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers
 Allowed values
 Default



 [-sequence]
(Parameter 1)
 Protein sequence(s) filename and optional format, or reference (input USA)
 Readable sequence(s)
 Required



 -minlen
 Minimum length of antigenic region
 Integer from 1 to 50
 6



 [-outfile]
(Parameter 2)
 Output report file name
 Report output file
 <*>.antigenic



 Additional (Optional) qualifiers
 Allowed values
 Default



 (none)



 Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers
 Allowed values
 Default



 (none)




Command line arguments

   The first parameter is the name of the program to compile. All other
   command line parameters and qualifiers are defined for that program -
   see the documentation for the program of choice.

Output file format

   The output file is empty, but any format available to the specified
   program can be used.

Data files

   Acdtable will use any data files specified in the ACD file of the
   specified program, but will ignore any data files that are only used
   directly by the program's code.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   acdtable does not have its own options, but takes a single parameter
   which is the name of the EMBOSS application that is being testsed. It
   is invoked by specifying the name of the application to be tested
   after the name of the utility application itself:

   acdtable ApplicationName

   Acceptable expected and default values can be generated automatically
   for most ACD datatypes. In other cases, the allowed values is defined
   with the valid: global attribute, and the default value by the
   expected: global attribute (see EMBOSS Developers Manual).
