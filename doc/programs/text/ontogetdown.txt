Function

   Get ontology term(s) by parent id

Description

   ontogetdown finds ontology terms matching a query. All children of the
   term, related to the term by 'is_a' (class/subclass) relationships, are
   returned. The information may be written to an output file in various
   formats.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ontogetdown


% ontogetdown edam:0850

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS ontology query.

   The major ontology sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations
   are EDAM, GO (gene Ontology) and SO (Sequence Ontology).

   Data can also be read from ontology output in "obo" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:0850

[Term]
id: EDAM_data:0850
name: Sequence set
namespace: data
def: A collection of multiple molecular sequences and associated metadata that d
o not (typically) correspond to molecular sequence database records or entries a
nd which (typically) are derived from some analytical method.
comment: This concept may be used for arbitrary sequence sets and associated dat
a arising from processing.
subset: bioinformatics
subset: data
subset: edam
synonym: "SO:0001260" RELATED []
created_in: "beta12orEarlier"
is_a: EDAM_data:2955 ! Sequence report


Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
