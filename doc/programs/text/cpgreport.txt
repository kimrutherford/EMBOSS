Function

   Reports all CpG rich regions

Description

   cpgreport scans a nucleotide sequence for regions with higher than
   expected frequencies of the dinucleotide CG.

   CpG refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases.

   Detection of regions of genomic sequences that are rich in the CpG
   pattern is important because such regions are resistant to methylation
   and tend to be associated with genes which are frequently switched on.
   Regions rich in the CpG pattern are known as CpG islands.

   This program does not find CpG islands as normally defined: "a region
   of greater than 200 bp with a %GC of greater than 50% and
   observed/expected CpG > 0.6". cpgreport instead uses a running sum
   rather than a window to create the score as follows: if not CpG at
   position i, then decrement running-Sum counter, but if CpG then
   running-Sum counter is incremented by the CPGSCORE. Spans greater than
   the threshold are searched for recursively.

   This method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around
   primary exons.

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -score              integer    [17] This sets the score for each CG
                                  sequence found. A value of 17 is more
                                  sensitive, but 28 has also been used with
                                  some success. (Integer from 1 to 200)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.cpgreport] Output file name

   The first non-blank line of the output file 'rnu68037.cpgreport' is
   the title line giving the program name, the name of sequence being
   analysed and the start and end positions of the sequence.

   The second non-blank line contains the headings of the columns.

   Subsequent lines contain columns with the following information:

     * The name of the sequence.
     * The begin position and the end position of the CpG-rich region.
     * The score of the CpG-rich region.
     * The number of CpG's in the CpG-rich region.
     * The %(G+C) in the CpG-rich region.
     * The ratio of CpG to GpC in the CpG-rich region.

   If the count of GpC in the region is zero, then the ratio of CG/GC is
   reported as '-'.

   Program name                        Description
   cpgplot      Plot CpG rich areas
   geecee       Calculates fractional GC content of nucleic acid sequences
   newcpgreport Report CpG rich areas
   newcpgseek   Reports CpG rich regions

   As there is no official definition of what is a cpg island is, and
   worst where they begin and end, we have to live with 2 definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. newcpgseek and cpgreport - both declare a putative island if the
   score is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment). They now also
   displaying the actual CpG count, the % CG and the observed/expected
   ration in the region where the score is above the threshold. This
   scoring method based on sum/frequencies overpredicts islands but finds
   the smaller ones around primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method
   as cpgreport but the output is different and more readable.

   2. newcpgreport and cpgplot use a sliding window within which the
   Obs/Exp ratio of CpG is calculated. The important thing to note in
   this method is that an island, in order to be reported, is defined as
   a region that satisfies the following contraints:

   Obs/Exp ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Length > 200.

   For all practical purposes you should probably use newcpgreport. It is
   actually used to produce the human cpgisland database you can find on
   the EBI's ftp server as well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   geecee measures CG content in the entire input sequence and is not to
   be used to detect CpG islands. It can be usefull for detecting
   sequences that MIGHT contain an island.
