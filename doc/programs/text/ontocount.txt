Command line arguments

Count ontology term(s)
Version: EMBOSS:6.5.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-oboterms]          obo        Obo term filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input query)

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS ontology query.

   The major ontology sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations
   are EDAM, GO (gene Ontology) and SO (Sequence Ontology).

   Data can also be read from ontology output in "obo" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:1234

[Term]
id: EDAM_data:1234
name: Sequence set (nucleic acid)
namespace: data
def: Any collection of multiple nucleotide sequences and associated metadata tha
t do not (typically) correspond to common sequence database records or database
entries.
subset: data
is_a: EDAM_data:0850 ! Sequence set
is_a: EDAM_data:2977 ! Nucleic acid sequence
