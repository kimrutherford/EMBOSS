Function

   Checks for more recent updates to EMBOSS

Description

   embossupdate checks for the latest EMBOSS updates and reports if a more
   recent version is available.

Algorithm

   The EMBOSS webite maintains a page for the latest release with all
   fixes available as patches or as new distributions.

   embossupdate reads this page and reports a description of any changes
   and instructions for updating. These are read from the updates page and
   subject to change.

   If no later version is found embossupdate reports success.
