Function

   Search for patterns in protein sequences

Description

   fuzznuc searches for a specified PROSITE-style pattern in protein
   sequences. Such patterns are specifications of a (typically short)
   length of sequence to be found. They can specify a search for an exact
   sequence or they can allow various ambiguities, matches to variable
   lengths of sequence and repeated subsections of the sequence. One or
   more protein sequences are read from file. The output is a standard
   EMBOSS report file that includes data such as location and score of any
   matches.

Algorithm

   fuzznuc intelligently selects the optimum searching algorithm to use,
   depending on the complexity of the search pattern specified.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with fuzzpro

Command line arguments

Search for patterns in protein sequences
Version: EMBOSS:6.6.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Protein sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -pattern            pattern    The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the
                                  amino acids are used.
                                  The symbol 'x' is used for a position where
                                  any amino acid is accepted.
                                  Ambiguities are indicated by listing the
                                  acceptable amino acids for a given position,
                                  between square parentheses '[ ]'. For
                                  example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
                                  Ambiguities are also indicated by listing
                                  between a pair of curly brackets '{ }' the
                                  amino acids that are not accepted at a given
                                  position. For example: {AM} stands for any
                                  amino acid except Ala and Met.
                                  Each element in a pattern is separated from
                                  its neighbor by a '-'. (Optional in
                                  fuzzpro).
                                  Repetition of an element of the pattern can
                                  be indicated by following that element with
                                  a numerical value or a numerical range
                                  between parenthesis. Examples: x(3)
                                  corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4) corresponds to
                                  x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
                                  When a pattern is restricted to either the
                                  N- or C-terminal of a sequence, that pattern
                                  either starts with a '<' symbol or
                                  respectively ends with a '>' symbol.
                                  A period ends the pattern. (Optional in
                                  fuzzpro).
                                  For example, [DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C
  [-outfile]           report     [*.fuzzpro] Output report file name (default
                                  -rformat seqtable)

Input file format

   fuzzpro reads in one or more protein sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

  Input files for usage example

   'tsw:*' is a sequence entry in the example protein database 'tsw'

  Pattern specification

   Patterns for fuzzpro are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.

   The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows.

     * The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.
     * The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
       accepted.
     * Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids for
       a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For example:
       [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
     * Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
       brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
       position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
       and Met.
     * Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbour by a `-'.
       (Optional in fuzzpro).
     * Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
       following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
       between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4)
       corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
     * When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
       sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or
       respectively ends with a `>' symbol.
     * A period ends the pattern. (Optional in fuzzpro).
     * All other characters, including spaces are not allowed.

   For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern:
[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C

   This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
   residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro
   followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.

   The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq,
   draw, restrict, excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions, seqtable,
   simple, srs, table, tagseq.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/ReportFormats.html for further
   information on report formats.

   By default fuzzpro writes a 'seqtable' report file.
