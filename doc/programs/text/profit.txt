Function

   Scan one or more sequences with a simple frequency matrix

Description

   profit scans one or more sequences with a simple frequency matrix and
   writes an output file with any high-scoring matches. All possible
   ungapped alignments of each sequence to the matrix are scored and any
   matches with a score higher than the specified threshold are written to
   the output file. The output file includes the name of any matching
   sequence found, the start position in the sequence of the match and the
   percentage of the maximum possible score.

Algorithm

   All possible ungapped alignments of each sequence to the frequency
   matrix are scored. The first alignment has the first positions of the
   sequence and matrix in the same register. If the sequence is larger
   than the matrix, there will be more than one alignment. Otherwise,
   there will be just one.

   The score for a match is simply the sum of scores at each position of
   the matrix for the corresponding residue from the sequence. The
   percentage of the maximum possible score reported in the output file is
   the sum of the highest value at each position in the frequency matrix.
   Where the match score is above the threshold percentage of the maximum
   possible score for that matrix, then a hit is reported.

Usage

   Before running the example, we need to make a simple frequency matrix
   using prophecy

   This is the ungapped aligned set of sequences used to make the matrix:

% more m.seq
>one
DEVGGEALGRLLVVYPWTQR
>two
DEVGREALGRLLVVYPWTQR
>three
DEVGGEALGRILVVYPWTQR
>four
DEVGGEAAGRVLVVYPWTQR

Input file format

   profit reads a simple frequency matrix produced by prophecy and uses it
   to search searches one or more protein or nucleic acid sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

Output file format

  Output files for usage example

  File: outfile.profit

# PROF scan using simple frequency matrix mymatrix
# Scores >= threshold 75 (max score 76)
#
HBB_HUMAN 22 Percentage: 100
HBB_PANPA 22 Percentage: 100
HBB_PANTR 22 Percentage: 100

   The output is a list of three columns.

   The first column is the name of the matching sequence found.
   The second is the start position in the sequence of the match.
   The third column (after the word 'Percentage:') is the percentage of
   the maximum possible score (sum of the highest value at each position
   in the frequency matrix).

Data files

   None.

Notes

   A 'simple frequency matrix' is simply a table containing a count of the
   number of times any particular amino acid occurs at each position in
   the sequence alignment from which it was derived. Simple frequency
   matrices are created using the program prophecy with the option -type F
   to create the correct type of matrix. The input alignment should not
   have gaps in it.

References

   None.

Warnings

   The aligned set of sequences used to make the simple frquency matrix
   should not have gaps in it. profit will let you use a matrix made from
   a gapped alignment, but the results will probably not be sensible.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with a status of 0.

Known bugs

   None.
