Function

   Plot conservation of a sequence alignment

Description

   plotcon reads a sequence alignment and draws a plot of the sequence
   conservation within windows over the alignment.

Algorithm

   Sequence conservation is calculated for windows of a specified length
   over the alignment. Within a window, the similarity of any one position
   is taken to be the average of all the possible pairwise substitution
   scores of the bases or residues at that position. The pairwise
   substitution scores are taken from the specified similarity matrix. The
   average of the position similarities within the window is plotted.

   The average similarity is calculated by:

Av. Sim. =       sum( Mij*wi + Mji*wj  )
                      -------------------
                  (Nseq*Wsize)*((Nseq-1)*Wsize)

sum - over column*window size
w - sequence weighting
M - matrix comparison table
i,j - with respect to residue i or j
Nseq - number of sequences in the alignment
Wsize - window size

Output file format

   A graph of the quality of the alignment is dispalyed on the specifed
   graphics device.

  Output files for usage example

  Graphics File: plotcon.ps

   [plotcon results]

Data files

   It reads in the specified similarity matrix.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   The program is useful for visualising the quality of alignment along
   its length. This can give a qualitative insight into where there are
   regions of conservation in a group of aligned sequences.

   Note that you should only compare the results of two runs of plotcon if
   you use the same window size in each. This is because the 'similarity
   score' units that are output are very sensitive to the size of the
   window. A large window (e.g. 100) gives a nice, smooth curve, and very
   low 'similarity score' units, whereas a small window (e.g. 4) gives a
   very spikey, noisy plot with 'similarity score' units of a round 1.00

References

   None.

Warnings

   plotcon does not distinguish between aligned and unaligned sets of
   sequences. If the input set of sequences is unaligned, the output will
   in most cases lack much biological meaning.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
