Function

   Write a list file of the logical OR of two sets of sequences

Description

   listor reads in two sets of sequences (typically specified as list
   files) and writes out a list file that result from the logical union of
   the two sets. A list file is a file with a list of Uniform Sequence
   Addresses (USAs), for example, a list of file names. When comparing
   sequences from the input sets, no use is made of the ID name or
   accession number; only the sequence itself is compared. The comparison
   of the sequences is case-independent. The logical union is an OR
   operation by default. Other available operations are: AND, XOR and NOT.

Algorithm

   All the input sequences are kept in memory while the logical unions of
   the two input sets of sequences is calculated. listor is therefore
   restricted by the available memory.

Input file format

   The input sets of sequences can be of any valid USAs. The program was
   written to perform logical operations on list files, but in practice,
   wildcarded database entries and file names are also perfectly legal
   specifications of the input sequences.

  Input files for usage example

  File: file1

>one
tagctagcg
>two
tagctagcggctacgt
>three
tagctattttatgctacgtcagtgac

  File: file2

>two
tagctagcggctacgt
>three
tagctattttatgctacgtcagtgac
>four
gcgcggcgcgcgtgcgtcgttgctggggccc

Output file format

   The output is simply a list of the USAs (format and sequence
   specification) resulting from the required logical union of the two
   sets of input sequence.

   The order that the USAs are written out is not necessarily the same as
   the order of either of the input sets of sequences.

   The results of the four types of logical union follows. Note that the
   duplicated sequences in these two files have been given the same name.
   This is not necessary for the operation of listor as it compares the
   sequences themselves, not the ID names of the sequences.

  Output files for usage example

  File: file1.list

fasta::../../data/file1:one
fasta::../../data/file1:two
fasta::../../data/file1:three
fasta::../../data/file2:four

  Output files for usage example 2

  File: file1.list

fasta::../../data/file1:two
fasta::../../data/file1:three

  Output files for usage example 3

  File: file1.list

fasta::../../data/file1:one
fasta::../../data/file2:four

  Output files for usage example 4

  File: file1.list

fasta::../../data/file1:one

Data files

   None.

Notes

   The inputs can be any valid USA but typically reference a list file.
   Some other reference such as a wildcarded database entries or file name
   are equally valid.

   The (default) logical OR of the two sets of sequences is simply the
   result of merging the two sets of sequences. A sequences appearing in
   both input sets is referenced once only in the output file. A logical
   AND simply lists those sequences that occur in both sets of sequences.

   A logical XOR lists those sequences that ONLY occur in the first set or
   only occur in the second set - sequences occuring in both sets are
   omitted (the opposite of an AND).

   A logical NOT lists all those sequences in the first set except for
   those that also occur in the second set.

References

   None.

Warnings

   listor is restricted by the available memory. Doing logical unions
   involving all of the sequences in large databases, such as EMBL, is
   probably impractical unless you are lucky enough to have extraordinary
   amounts of memory on your machine.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
