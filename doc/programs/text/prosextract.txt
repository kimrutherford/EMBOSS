Function

   Build the PROSITE motif database for use by patmatmotifs

Description

   Takes the IDentity, ACcession number and motif PAttern line contents
   from prosite entries. Also converts the PAttern into a regular
   expression and writes these four pieces to an output file - defaulted
   to be called 'prosite.lines'.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with prosextract


% prosextract 
Build the PROSITE motif database for use by patmatmotifs
PROSITE database directory [.]: 

   Go to the output files for this example

   The output files named after the prosite accession numbers can now
   also be seen in the prosite directory. This files are automatically
   created after prosextract is run.
