Function

   Calculate and plot enzyme reaction data

Description

   findkm reads a file of enzymatic reaction data (substrate concentration
   [S] versus reaction velocity [V]) and draws Michaelis Menten and Hanes
   Woolf plots of the data. From these it calculates the Michaelis Menten
   constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction. An
   output file with all relevant data is written.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with findkm


% findkm -graph cps
Calculate and plot enzyme reaction data
Enzyme kinetics data (application-specific) file: enztest.dat
Output file [enztest.findkm]:

Created findkm.ps
