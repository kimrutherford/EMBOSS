Function

   Get all species under taxon(s)

Description

   taxgetspecies reads in one or more taxons, finds all taxons below in
   the hierarchy, and writes out any at the species level. The taxon input
   may be a literal sequence or read from a database, file, file of taxon
   names, or even the command-line or the output of another programs. The
   taxon output can be written to screen, to file, or passed to another
   program. A wide range of standard taxon formats may be specified for
   input and output.

Algorithm

   The NCBI taxonomy records the parent of each taxon, up to a known top
   level 1.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with taxgetspecies

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS taxonomy query.

   The expected source of taxonomy information is the NCBI Taxonomy
   database "taxon" which is available as a standard database in all
   EMBOSS installations.

   Data can also be read from taxonomy output in "ncbi" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TaxonFormats.html for further
   information on taxon formats.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: taxon-tax:hominidae

id: 9604
parent: 314295
rank: family
emblprefix:

mitocode: 2
mgcflag 1

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS taxon file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: ncbi, ebi,
   tax, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TaxonFormats.html for further
   information on taxon formats.
