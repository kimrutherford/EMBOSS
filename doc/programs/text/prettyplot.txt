Function

   Draw a sequence alignment with pretty formatting

Description

   prettyplot draws a plot of the input sequence alignment. The sequences
   are rendered in pretty formatting on the specified graphics device.
   Drawing options control the appearance of the image, such as boxes,
   colour and shading for highlighting conserved regions.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with prettyplot


% prettyplot -resbreak=10 -boxcol -consensus -plurality=3
Draw a sequence alignment with pretty formatting
Input (aligned) sequence set: globins.msf

Data files

   Prettyplot uses a comparison matrix file to calculate similarity to the
   consensus.

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   A consesnsus sequence is calculated for the alignment and individual
   sequences compared to the consensus using the specified comparison
   matrix file. The default matrix for protein sequences is EBLOSUM62 and
   for nucleotide sequences is EDNAFULL. The drawing options render
   conserved sites and regions identified from the comparisons. For
   example, residues in a sequence are classed as "identical", "similar"
   or "other" to the consensus depending on user-specified thresholds of
   sequence similarity (-pair option). Residues in each class are rendered
   red, green and black by default (this can be changed).

   There are other more general drawing options, for example, controlling
   the number of residues displayed per line, background shading and
   whether to display sequence names or not.
