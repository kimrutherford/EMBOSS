Function

   Search a DNA database for matches with a set of STS primers

Description

   stssearch searches one or more DNA sequences with a set of STS primers
   and reports expected matches. The database to search, the input primer
   pairs file and an output file for matches are specified. For each pair
   of primers, it looks for matches between the primers and the query
   sequence in either orientation. Details of any matches are written to
   the output file. Only one primer need match for it to be reported.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with stssearch


% stssearch
Search a DNA database for matches with a set of STS primers
Input nucleotide sequence(s): @eclac.list
Primer pairs file: lac.primers
Output file [j01636.stssearch]:


   Go to the input files for this example

   The primers file consists of three columns separated by tabs or spaces.

   The first column is the name of the primer pair.
   The second column is the sequence of the first primer.
   The third column is the sequence of the second primer.

V00296: (rev) PrimC PrimerB matched at 1783

   The output file consists of one line per match. This consists of:

     * The name of the sequence that the match is found in, followed by a
       ':'.
     * If the match is in the reverse sense, it has a '(rev)'.
     * The name of the primer pair.
     * 'PrimerA' or 'PrimerB'.
     * 'matched at' the start of the match position.

                    If you want something that only reports matches of both primer pairs
                    and can find mismatches, use primersearch.
