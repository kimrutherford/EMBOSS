Function

   Removes carriage return from ASCII files

Description

   The way that Unix and PC operating systems store simple text files,
   (including sequence files), differs slightly.

   Unix files have a hidden character called 'new line' at the end of
   every line.

   PC files have two hidden characters called 'carriage return' and then
   'new line' at the end of every line.

   When files are transferred from PC machines to Unix machines, it is
   often useful to convert the file from the PC format to the Unix
   format, otherwise commands like 'more', to display the file, and text
   editors can become confused.

   This simple utility removes 'carriage return' characters from such
   files, converting them from PC format to Unix format text files.

   EMBOSS programs can read in both PC and Unix text file formats, so it
   is not necessary for you to use this utility all of the time.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with noreturn


% noreturn abc.dat 
Removes carriage return from ASCII files
ASCII text output file [abc.noreturn]: 

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-infile]            infile     ASCII text file
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.noreturn] ASCII text output file

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -system             menu       [unix] Target operating system for
                                  end-of-line format (Values: unix (Unix/Linux
                                  systems); pc (Windows/DOS); mac (Apple
                                  Macintosh))

   Associated qualifiers:

   "-outfile" associated qualifiers
   -odirectory2        string     Output directory

   General qualifiers:
   -auto               boolean    Turn off prompts
   -stdout             boolean    Write standard output
   -filter             boolean    Read standard input, write standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values
   -debug              boolean    Write debug output to program.dbg
   -verbose            boolean    Report some/full command line options
   -help               boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   -warning            boolean    Report warnings
   -error              boolean    Report errors
   -fatal              boolean    Report fatal errors
   -die                boolean    Report dying program messages

Input file format

   The input file is a text data file with unwanted trailing carriage
   returns.

  Input files for usage example

  File: abc.dat

>ABC Test sequence with PC carriage return format
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY

Output file format

  Output files for usage example

  File: abc.noreturn

>ABC Test sequence with PC carriage return format
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY

   The output file is identical to the input file, except that any
   trailing carriage returns have been removed. For most files this will
   make no difference.

Data files

   None.
