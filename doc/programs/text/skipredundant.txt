Function

   Remove redundant sequences from an input set

Description

   Redundancy in a database or other collection of sequences occurs when
   one or more similar sequences are present. The inclusion of very
   similar sequences in certain analyses will introduce undesirable bias.
   For example, a family may possess 100 sequences in the sequence
   database, but 90 of these might be essentially the same sequence, e.g.
   very close relatives or mutations of a single sequence. Although 100
   sequences are known, the family only contains 11 sequences that are
   essentially unique. For many applications it is desirable or even
   essential to remove redundant sequences from a set in order to produce
   a smaller set that is representative of the whole. SEQNR removes
   redundancy from an input file of sequences, either at a single
   threshold of sequence similiarty (e.g. 40%) or within a threshold range
   of sequence similiarty (e.g. 40% - 70%).

Algorithm

   Redundancy is calculated for each pair of sequences in turn.

Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequences]         seqset     Sequence set filename and optional format,
                                  or reference (input USA)
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies whether to remove
                                  redundancy at a single threshold percentage
                                  sequence similarity or remove redundancy
                                  outside a range of acceptable threshold
                                  percentage similarity. All permutations of
                                  pair-wise sequence alignments are calculated
                                  for each set of input sequences in turn
                                  using the EMBOSS implementation of the
                                  Needleman and Wunsch global alignment
                                  algorithm. Redundant sequences are removed
                                  in one of two modes as follows: (i) If a
                                  pair of proteins achieve greater than a
                                  threshold percentage sequence similarity
                                  (specified by the user) the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (ii) If a pair of
                                  proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range (specified by the user) the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (Values: 1 (Single
                                  threshold percentage sequence similarity); 2
                                  (Outside a range of acceptable threshold
                                  percentage similarities))
*  -threshold          float      [95.0] This option specifies the percentage
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold. The
                                  percentage sequence identity redundancy
                                  threshold determines the redundancy
                                  calculation. If a pair of proteins achieve
                                  greater than this threshold the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (Any numeric value)
*  -minthreshold       float      [30.0] This option specifies the percentage
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold
                                  (lower limit). The percentage sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold determines the
                                  redundancy calculation. If a pair of
                                  proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range the shortest sequence is discarded.
                                  (Any numeric value)
*  -maxthreshold       float      [90.0] This option specifies the percentage
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold
                                  (upper limit). The percentage sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold determines the
                                  redundancy calculation. If a pair of
                                  proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range the shortest sequence is discarded.
                                  (Any numeric value)
   -gapopen            float      [10.0 for any sequence] The gap open penalty
                                  is the score taken away when a gap is
                                  created. The best value depends on the
                                  choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
                                  (Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0)
   -gapextend          float      [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension,
                                  penalty is added to the standard gap penalty
                                  for each base or residue in the gap. This
                                  is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you
                                  will expect a few long gaps rather than many
                                  short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
                                  should be lower than the gap penalty. An
                                  exception is where one or both sequences are
                                  single reads with possible sequencing
                                  errors in which case you would expect many
                                  single base gaps. You can get this result by
                                  setting the gap open penalty to zero (or
                                  very low) and using the gap extension
                                  penalty to control gap scoring. (Floating
                                  point number from 0.0 to 10.0)

   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be specified.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
