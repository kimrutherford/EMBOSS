Function

   Index a GCG formatted database using b+tree indices

Description

   dbxgcg indexes a flat file database of one or more files, and builds
   EMBOSS B+tree format index files. These indexes allow access of flat
   files larger than 2Gb.

Input file format

   dbxgcg reads any normal sequence USAs.

Output file format

   dbxgcg creates one summary file for the database and two files for
   each field indexed.

     * dbalias.ent is the master file containing the names of the files
       that have been indexed. It is an ASCII file. This file also
       contains the database release and date information.
     * dbalias.xid is the B+tree index file for the ID names. It is a
       binary file.
     * dbalias.pxid is an ASCII file containing information regarding the
       structure of the ID name index.

Notes

   The indexing system has been designed to allow on-the-fly updating of
   indexes. This feature is, however, not implemented in the current
   version. It will be made available in future releases.

   Having created the EMBOSS indexes for this file, a database can then
   be defined in the file emboss.defaults as something like:
DB embl [
   type: N
   dbalias: embl   (see below)
   format: embl
   method: embossgcg
   directory: /data/gcg/embl
   file: *.seq
   indexdirectory: /data/gcg/embl/indexes
]

   The index file 'basename' given to dbxgcg must match the DB name in
   the definition. If not, then a 'dbalias' line must be given which
   specifies the basename of the indexes.

  Fields Indexed

   By default, dbxgcg will index the ID name and the accession number (if
   present).
   If they are present in your database, you may also specify that dbxgcg
   should index the Sequence Version and GI, the words in the
   description, the keywords and the organism words using the '-fields'
   qualifier with the appropriate values.

Global Parameters

   dbxgcg requires that two global parameters be defined in the file
   emboss.defaults. These are:
SET PAGESIZE 2048
SET CACHESIZE 200

   The above values are recommended for most systems. The PAGESIZE is a
   multiple of the size of disc pages the operating system buffers. The
   CACHESIZE is the number of disc pages dbxgcg is allowed to cache.

Resources

   dbxgcg will ask you for the name of a resource definition in the file
   emboss.defaults. This will be something like:
RES embl [
   type: Index
   idlen:  15
   acclen: 15
   svlen:  20
   keylen: 25
   deslen: 25
   orglen: 25
]

   The length definitions are the maximum lengths of 'words' in the field
   being indexed. Longer words will be truncated to the value set.

References

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
