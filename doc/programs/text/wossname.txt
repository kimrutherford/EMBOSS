Function

   Finds programs by keywords in their short description

Description

   wossname search for the specified keywords (or parts thereof) in the
   application short description (as displayed by a program when it
   starts), functional group name and keywords. The group name,
   application name and short description of any matching applications is
   output (screen by default). If no search words are specified, then
   details of all the EMBOSS programs are output. There are various
   options for controlling how the search is performed and what is given
   in the output file. Optionally, the output will be wrapped in HTML
   tags ready for inclusion in a Web page.

Usage

  [-search]            string     Enter a word or words here and a
                                  case-independent search for it will be made
                                  in the one-line documentation, group names
                                  and keywords of all of the EMBOSS programs.
                                  If no keyword is specified, all programs
                                  will be listed. (Any string is accepted)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -explode            boolean    [N] The groups that EMBOSS applications
                                  belong to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
   -[no]allmatch       boolean    [Y] By default, all words in the search
                                  string must match. This option searches for
                                  a match to any word in a list of
                                  possibilities
   -showkeywords       boolean    [N] Show keywords with program documentation
   -outfile            outfile    [stdout] Output file name
   -html               toggle     [N] If you are sending the output to a file,
                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
   -groups             boolean    [N] If you use this option, then only the
                                  group names will output to the file
   -alphabetic         boolean    [N] If you use this option, then you will
                                  get a single list of the program names and
                                  descriptions instead of the programs being
                                  listed in their functional groups.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]emboss         boolean    [Y] If you use this option then EMBOSS
                                  program documentation will be searched. If
                                  this option is set to be false, then only
                                  the EMBASSY programs will be searched (if
                                  the -embassy option is true). EMBASSY
                                  programs are not strictly part of EMBOSS,
                                  but use the same code libraries and share
                                  the same look and feel, but are generally
                                  developed by people who wish the programs to
                                  be outside of the GNU Public Licence scheme
   -[no]embassy        boolean    [Y] If you use this option then EMBASSY
                                  program documentation will be searched. If
                                  this option is set to be false, then only
                                  the EMBOSS programs will be searched (if the
                                  -emboss option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the
                                  same code libraries and share the same look
                                  and feel, but are generally developed by
                                  people who wish the programs to be outside
                                  of the GNU Public Licence scheme
   -showembassy        string     If you use this option then this EMBASSY
                                  package program documentation will be
                                  searched. EMBASSY programs are not strictly
                                  part of EMBOSS, but use the same code
                                  libraries and share the same look and feel,
                                  but are generally developed by people who
                                  wish the programs to be outside of the GNU
                                  Public Licence scheme (Any string is
                                  accepted)
   -colon              boolean    [N] The groups that EMBOSS applications
                                  belong to up to two levels, for example the
                                  primary group 'ALIGNMENT' has several
                                  sub-groups, or second-level groups, e.g.:
                                  CONSENSUS, DIFFERENCES, DOT PLOTS, GLOBAL,
                                  LOCAL, MULTIPLE. To aid programs that parse
                                  the output of wossname that require the
                                  names of these subgroups, a colon ':' will
                                  be placed between the first and second level
                                  of the group name if this option is true.
                                  Note: This does not apply if the group names
                                  have been exploded with the 'explode'
                                  option.
   -gui                boolean    [N] This option is intended to help those
                                  who are designing Graphical User Interfaces
                                  to the EMBOSS applications. Some EMBOSS
                                  programs are inappropriate for running in a
                                  GUI, these include other menu programs and
                                  interactive editors. This option allows you
                                  to only report those programs that can be
                                  run from a GUI

                                  first file to standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values

Input file format

   wossname reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from the
   ACD files. (ACD files control the parameters that the programs expect
   - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS programs).

   The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.

Output file format

   The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
   that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for.

  Output files for usage example 5

   If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
   the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
   page. Note that tags such as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are
   not output by this program as the list of programs is expected to form
   only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of the web page
   must be supplied by the user.

Data files

   As noted above, the program ACD files are searched. The average user
   will not need to worry about this.

Notes

   wossname reads the short descriptions and the program groups from the
   program ACD files. These file describe the command-line interface of
   the applications. You don't need to know about them unless you are
   writing EMBOSS programs. They are described in the EMBOSS Developers
   Manual.

   If a program's ACD file does not specify a program group, then it will
   be automatically assigned to the group ASSORTED in the output file. A
   program can belong to more than one group.
