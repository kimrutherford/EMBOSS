Function

   Display a multiple sequence alignment in pretty format

Description

   showalign reads a set of aligned protein or a nucleic acid sequences,
   and writes them to file (or screen) in a style suitable for
   publication. Similarities and differences of each sequence to a
   reference sequence are highlighted for specified types of matches. The
   reference sequence can be the calculated consensus sequence (default)
   or one of the input set (specified by name or the ordinal number of
   that sequence in the file). The output sequences can be displayed in
   either the input order (the default), sorted in order of their
   similarity to the reference sequence, or sorted alphabetically by their
   names. There are many other options to control the content and format
   of the output.

Command line arguments

Display a multiple sequence alignment in pretty format
Version: EMBOSS:6.5.6.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqset     The sequence alignment to be displayed.
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.showalign] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -matrix             matrix     [EBLOSUM62 for protein, EDNAFULL for DNA]
                                  This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
   -refseq             string     [0] If you give the number in the alignment
                                  or the name of a sequence, it will be taken
                                  to be the reference sequence. The reference
                                  sequence is always shown in full and is the
                                  one against which all the other sequences
                                  are compared. If this is set to 0 then the
                                  consensus sequence will be used as the
                                  reference sequence. By default the consensus
                                  sequence is used as the reference sequence.
                                  (Any string)
   -[no]bottom         boolean    [Y] If this is true then the reference
                                  sequence is displayed at the bottom of the
                                  alignment instead of the top.
   -show               menu       [N] What to show (Values: A (All of the
                                  sequences); I (Identities between the
                                  sequences); N (Non-identities between the
                                  sequences); S (Similarities between the
                                  sequences); D (Dissimilarities between the
                                  sequences))
   -order              menu       [I] Output order of the sequences (Values: I
                                  (Input order - no change); A (Alphabetical
                                  order of the names); S (Similarity to the
                                  reference sequence))
   -[no]similarcase    boolean    [Y] If this is set True, then when -show is
                                  set to 'Similarities' or 'Non-identities'
                                  and a residue is similar but not identical
                                  to the reference sequence residue, it will
                                  be changed to lower-case. If -show is set to
                                  'All' then non-identical, non-similar
                                  residues will be changed to lower-case. If
                                  this is False then no change to the case of
                                  the residues is made on the basis of their
                                  similarity to the reference sequence.
   -[no]consensus      boolean    [Y] If this is true then the consensus line
                                  is displayed.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -uppercase          range      [If this is left blank, then the sequence
                                  case is left alone.] Regions to put in
                                  uppercase.
                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence
                                  case is left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45, 56-78
                                  1:45, 67=99;765..888
                                  1,5,8,10,23,45,57,99
   -[no]number         boolean    [Y] If this option is true then a line
                                  giving the positions in the alignment is
                                  displayed every 10 characters above the
                                  alignment.
   -[no]ruler          boolean    [Y] If this option is true then a ruler line
                                  marking every 5th and 10th character in the
                                  alignment is displayed.
   -width              integer    [60] Width of sequence to display (Integer 1
                                  or more)
   -margin             integer    [-1] This sets the length of the left-hand
                                  margin for sequence names. If the margin is
                                  set at 0 then no margin and no names are
                                  displayed. If the margin is set to a value
                                  that is less than the length of a sequence
                                  name then the sequence name is displayed
                                  truncated to the length of the margin. If
                                  the margin is set to -1 then the minimum
                                  margin width that will allow all the
                                  sequence names to be displayed in full plus
                                  a space at the end of the name will
                                  automatically be selected. (Integer -1 or
                                  more)
   -html               boolean    [N] Use HTML formatting
   -highlight          range      [(full sequence)] Regions to colour if
                                  formatting for HTML.
                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence is
                                  left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are followed by any valid HTML font
                                  colour.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45 blue 56-78 orange
                                  1-100 green 120-156 red
                                  A file of ranges to colour (one range per
                                  line) can be specified as '@filename'.
   -plurality          float      [50.0] Set a cut-off for the % of positive

                                  consensus. The default plurality is taken as
                                  50% of the total weight of all the
                                  sequences in the alignment. (Number from
                                  0.000 to 100.000)
   -setcase            float      [@( $(sequence.totweight) / 2)] Sets the
                                  threshold for the scores of the positive
                                  matches above which the consensus is in
                                  upper-case and below which the consensus is
                                  in lower-case. By default this is set to be
                                  half of the (weight-adjusted) number of
                                  sequences in the alignment. (Any numeric
                                  value)
   -identity           float      [0.0] Provides the facility of setting the
                                  required number of identities at a position
                                  for it to give a consensus. Therefore, if
                                  this is set to 100% only columns of
                                  identities contribute to the consensus.
                                  (Number from 0.000 to 100.000)
   -[no]gaps           boolean    [Y] If this option is true then gap
                                  characters can appear in the consensus. The
                                  alternative is 'N' for nucleotide, or 'X'
                                  for protein

   You can specify a file of ranges to display in uppercase by giving the
   '-uppercase' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file
   containing the ranges. (eg: '-upper @myfile').

   The format of the range file is:

     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or
     * TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.

   An example range file is:


# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region

   You can specify a file of ranges to highlight in a different colour
   when outputting in HTML format (using the '-html' qualifier) by giving
   the '-highlight' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the
   file containing the ranges. (eg: '-highlight @myfile').

   The format of this file is very similar to the format of the above
   uppercase range file, except that the text after the start and end
   positions is used as the HTML colour name. This colour name is used 'as
   is' when specifying the colour in HTML in a '' construct, (where 'xxx'
   is the name of the colour).

   The standard names of HTML font colours are given in
   http://http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5

   An example highlight range file is:


# this is my set of ranges
12   23         red
 4   5          darkturquoise
67   10348      #FFE4E1

Output file format

   showalign writes out a text file, optionally formatted for HTML.

Data files

   showalign reads in scoring matrices to determine the consensus sequence
   and to determine which matches are similar or not.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   showalign reads in a scoring matrix to determine the consensus sequence
   and to determine which matches are similar or not.

   By using the -show option, the displayed sequences can be shown as:
     * complete (-show=All),
     * only identical matches between the sequence and the reference
       sequence, all other positions being replaced by '.' characters
       (-show=Identities)
     * non-identical matches, with identical matches being replaced by '.'
       characters, similar matches are shown in lower case
       (-show=Non-identities)
     * similar matches, with non-similar matches being replaced by '.'
       characters, similar matches are shown in lower case
       (-show=Similarities)
     * dissimilar matches, with identical or similar matches being
       replaced by '.' characters (-show=Dissimilarities)

   Changing the similar matches to lowercase can optionally be disabled by
   using the option -nosimilarcase.

   A small table of the way these alignments are displayed illustrates
   this. If we have a reference protein sequence of "III" and a sequence
   aligned to this of "ILW", then we have an identical matching residue,
   then a similar one, then a dissimilar one. The different methods of
   display would give the following:
Reference       III

All             ILw
Identical       I..
Non-id          .lW
Similar         Il.
Dissimilar      ..W

   The consensus line can be displayed in a mixture of uppercase and
   lowercase symbols. Uppercase indicates a strong consensus and lowercase
   a weak one. The cutoff for setting the consensus case is set by the
   qualifier -setcase. If the number of residues at that position that
   match the consensus value is greater than this, then the symbol is in
   uppercase, otherwise the symbol is in lowercase. By default, the value
   of -setcase is set so that if there are more than 50% of residues
   identical to the consensus at that position, then the consensus is in
   uppercase. To put all of the consensus symbols into uppercase or
   lowercase, make -setcase zero or very large (try 100000 ?).

   Other display options include Sequence numbering ruler with ticks above
   the sequence. The width of a line can be set. The width of a margin to
   the left of the sequences that shows the sequence names can be set.
   Specified regions of the sequence can be displayed in uppercase to
   highlight them.

   The output can be formatted for HTML. If the output is being formatted
   for HTML, then specified regions of the sequence can be displayed in
   any valid HTML colours.
