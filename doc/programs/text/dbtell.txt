  Input files for usage example

   'tsw' is a sequence entry in the example protein database 'tsw'

Output file format

   The output file (plain text format) is an excerpt of and (by default)
   in the same format as the EMBOSS data file db.dat. The format of the
   file is explained in comments at the top of that file. Optionally, the
