Input file format

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:0195

[Term]
id: EDAM_topic:0195
name: Virtual PCR
namespace: topic
def: Topic concerning simulated polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
subset: topics
synonym: "PCR" EXACT [http://edamontology.org]
synonym: "Polymerase chain reaction" EXACT [http://edamontology.org]
is_obsolete: true ! {since=beta13}
consider: EDAM_topic:0077 ! Nucleic acid analysis


  Input files for usage example 2

  Database entry: edam:0575

[Term]
id: EDAM_operation:0575
name: Restriction map rendering
namespace: operation
def: Visualise restriction maps in DNA sequences.
subset: operations
is_a: EDAM_operation:0573 ! Map rendering

Output file format

   A single line per term is is given, including the term id, namespace
   and name, and whether it is obsolete or not.

Data files

   OBO-format ontologies must be installed in the EMBOSS data directory
   and indexed. This is done automatically for typical installations.
