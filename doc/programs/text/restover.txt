Function

   Find restriction enzymes producing a specific overhang

Description

   restover identifies restriction enzymes from the REBASE database that
   create the specified overhang sequence when they cut the input
   nucleotide sequence(s). It writes an output file which shows the base
   number, restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions.
   There are several options to control exactly what sites are reported
   and the format of the output file. Optionally, output in HTML may be
   generated.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with restover


% restover
Find restriction enzymes producing a specific overhang
Input nucleotide sequence(s): tembl:x65923
Overlap sequence: cg
Output file [x65923.restover]:

Input file format

   restover reads in one or more nucleotide sequences.

   The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

   Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
   installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

   Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -sformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em),
   genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir (nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw),
   dasgff and debug.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html for further
   information on sequence formats.

   The output from restover is a simple text one. The base number,
   restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are shown.
   Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue shown and that 5'
   cuts are referred to by their associated 3' number sequence. The
   program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites.

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

   The EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files are stored in directory
   'data/REBASE/*' under the EMBOSS installation directory.

   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.

   The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard
   EMBOSS data directory. The names are:
     * embossre.enz Cleavage information
     * embossre.ref Reference/methylation information
     * embossre.sup Supplier information

   The column information is described at the top of the data files

   The reported enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype)
   is specified in the REBASE database and the information is held in the
   data file 'embossre.equ'. You may edit this file to set your own
   preferred prototype, if you wish.

   The format of the file "embossre.equ" is
   Enzyme-name Prototype-name

   i.e. two columns of enzyme names separated by a space. The first name
   of the pair of enzymes is the name that is not preferred and the second
   is the preferred (prototype) name.

Notes

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of information
   about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It contains published
   and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites,
   isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity,
   crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.

   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/

   Several criteria may be set to control what sites are reported: -min,
   -max, -single (minimum or maximum number of cuts, or single site cuts
   only. -blunt (enzymes which cut at the same position on the forward and
   reverse strands). -sticky (enzymes which cut at different positions on
   the forward and reverse strands, leaving an overhang). -ambiguity
   (enzymes which have one or more N ambiguity codes in their pattern).
   -commercial (enzymes with a commercial supplier). -plasmid (allows
   searches for restriction enzyme recognition site and cut postions that
   span the end of the sequence).

   By default, only one enzyme of any group of isoschizomers (enzymes that
   have the same recognition site and cut positions) is reported. This
   behaviour can be changed by specifying '-nolimit', in which case all
   isoschizomers are reported. The default behaviour uses the
   representative enzyme of an isoschizomer group (the prototype) which is
   specified in the EMBOSS data file embossre.equ. This file is generated
   from the REBASE database by running rebaseextract. You may edit this
   file to set your own preferred prototype,if you wish.

Warnings

   restover uses the EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files stored in
   directory data/REBASE/* under the EMBOSS installation directory. These
   files must first be set up using the program rebaseextract. Running
   rebaseextract may be the job of your system manager.
