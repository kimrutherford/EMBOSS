<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This program takes the name of an existing program in EMBOSS (or a
program in one the associated EMBASSY packages) and gives a list of the
programs which share some functionality with it. 

<p>
It does this by noting the functional groups that the program belongs to
and reporting any programs which share those functional groups.
<p>

The functional groups of a program are set in the ACD file (this is the
part of the program in the EMBOSS system which specifies the required
parameters, some help on the parameters, the one-line description of the
program, etc.) Normally the names of the groups are fairly specific,
such as: "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION", resulting in the reporting of only a
tightly restricted set of other programs also dealing with the analysis
of "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION".  The '-explode' qualifier will increase the
number of groups that the program belongs to by splitting the group name
at selected points to produce such groups as: "NUCLEIC", "NUCLEIC
COMPOSITION" and "COMPOSITION".  All programs with the exploded group
names which also include "NUCLEIC" and "COMPOSITION" will now be
reported.  The result of this qualifier is thus a report of a larger
number of programs with a more tenuous link to the specified program. 
In other words, use the '-explode' qualifier to decrease the specificity
of the search. 

<p>
The groups that the program belongs to can be output by using the
'-groups' qualifier.

    Input file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/seealso.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/seealso.output" -->

<p>

The result is header line 'SEE ALSO' then a simple list of program names
followed by the one-line description of the program. 

<p>

If the '-html' qualifier is used, then the result is an HTML-formatted
table, lacking the HTML document structures such as &lt;HTML&gt;,
&lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;/BODY&gt;, &lt;/HTML&gt; which the user is expected
to provide as the table will usually be included in the middle of a
larger HTML document.
