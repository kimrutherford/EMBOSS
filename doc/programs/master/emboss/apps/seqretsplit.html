    Function

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>seqretsplit</b> is a variant of the standard program for reading
and writing sequences, <b>seqret</b>.  It performs exactly the same
function except that when it reads more than one sequence, it writes
each sequence to an individual file. In all other
respects, <b>skipseq</b> is the same as <b>seqret</b>.  Its main use
is therefore to split a file containing multiple sequences into many
files, each containing one sequence. There are many options built-in
into EMBOSS for detailed specification of the input and output
sequences, for example the sequence type and file format.  Optionally,
feature information will be read and written.</p>


<H2>
    Usage
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.usage" -->

<p>

The specification of the output file is not used in this case.
<p>

At some point this ought to change and you will not be prompted for the
output file at all.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>seqretsplit</b> reads a normal sequence USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.output" -->

<p>

One file for each input sequence is written out.

<p>

The names of the files it creates are derived from the ID name of the
sequence, followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence. 
You have no control over the names of the files it writes out. 

<p>

For example, if the files <i>embl:hsfa11*</i> are read in and the
output is specified as <i>wibble.seq</i>, then the following files are
expected to be created:

<p>

<pre>
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta
</pre>

<p>

(No file <i>wibble.seq</i> is created.)

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>See the documentation for <b>seqret</b> to see the full range of
things that you can do when reading and writing sequences.</p>

<p>Some non-EMBOSS programs will accept only single sequences.  In
such cases <b>seqretsplit</b> is useful for splitting a multiple
sequence file into many individual files.  Some EMBOSS programs will
also read only a single sequence, which may, however, be one of many
in a file. You can specify the sequence using the USA
filename:sequenceID.  Nonetheless, some people feel more comfortable
handling one sequence per file, so <b>seqretsplit</b> will be useful
to them too.</p>

<p>One file for each input sequence is written.  The names of the
files it creates are derived from the ID name of the sequence,
followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence. You have
no control over the names of the files it writes out. For example, if
the files <tt>embl:hsfa11*</tt> are read in and the output is
specified as <tt>wibble.seq</tt>, then the following files are
expected to be created:</p>

<pre>
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta
</pre>

<p>(No file wibble.seq is created.)</p>

    Warnings

None.

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

It always exits with status 0.

<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>

It shouldn't really prompt for the output filename.
<p>
This is a side effect of the way sequence output works in
EMBOSS. Writing multiple sequences to separate files (the -ossingle
qualifier) does this, and seqretsplit has set it automatically on.
