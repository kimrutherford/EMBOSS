    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

<b>dbxfasta</b> indexes a flat file database of one or more files, and builds
EMBOSS B+tree format index files.

<p>
These indexes allow access of flat
files larger than 2Gb.


<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>dbxfasta</b> reads and indexes FASTA format sequence data files.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/dbxfasta.input" -->





<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<b>dbxfasta</b> creates one summary file for the database and two files
for each field indexed.

<p>

<ul>

<li>dbalias.ent is the master file containing the names of the files
that have been indexed. It is an ASCII file. This file also contains
the database release and date information.

<li>dbalias.xid is the B+tree index file for the ID names. It is a binary
file.

<li>dbalias.pxid is an ASCII file containing information regarding the
structure of the ID name index.

</ul>


<p>

None.











<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

The indexing system has been designed to allow on-the-fly updating
of indexes. This feature is, however, not implemented in the current
version. It will be made available in future releases.


<p>

Having created the EMBOSS indexes for this file, a database can then be
defined in the file <b>emboss.defaults</b> as something like:

<pre>
DB emrod [
   type: N
   dbalias: emrod   (see below)
   format: fasta
   method: emboss
   directory: /data/embl/fasta
   file: emrod.fasta
   indexdirectory: /data/embl/fasta/indexes
]
</pre>

The index file 'basename' given to <b>dbxfasta</b> must match the DB name
in the definition. If not, then a 'dbalias' line must be given which
specifies the basename of the indexes. 

<h3>Fields Indexed</H3>

By default, <b>dbxfasta</b> will index the ID name and the accession
number (if present).

<br>

If they are present in your database, you may also specify that
<b>dbxfasta</b> should index the Sequence Version and GI, the words
in the description, the keywords and the organism words using the
'-fields' qualifier with the appropriate values.   





<H2>
    Global Parameters
</H2>

<b>dbxfasta</b> requires that two global parameters be defined in
the file <b>emboss.defaults</b>. These are:

<pre>
SET PAGESIZE 2048
SET CACHESIZE 200
</pre>

The above values are recommended for most systems. The PAGESIZE is
a multiple of the size of disc pages the operating system buffers.
The CACHESIZE is the number of disc pages <b>dbxfasta</b> is
allowed to cache.


<H2>
    Resources
</H2>


<b>dbxfasta</b> will ask you for the name of a resource definition
in the file <b>emboss.defaults</b>. This will be something like:

<pre>
RES embl [
   type: Index
   idlen:  15
   acclen: 15
   svlen:  20
   keylen: 25
   deslen: 25
   orglen: 25
]
</pre>

The length definitions are the maximum lengths of 'words' in the
field being indexed. Longer words will be truncated to the
value set.

    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program, eg:
        "FATAL xxx" - means you have not set up the xxx data using program <b>prog</b>.<p>
   -->

None.







<H2>
    Exit status

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions
   -->

It always exits with status 0.
