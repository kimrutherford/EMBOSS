    Description
</H2>

<b>distmat</b> calculates the evolutionary distances between every pair of
sequences in a multiple alignment. The sequences need to be aligned
before running this program. The quality of the alignment is of
paramount importance in obtaining meaningful information from this
analysis. This application calculates a distance matrix for the set of
sequences in the alignment. The distances are expressed in terms of the
number of substitutions per 100 bases or amino acids.

<p>

   As sequence diverge so does the probability of there being multiple
substitutions at any one site in the alignment increase. The distance
will then be an underestimate of the true evolutionary distance between
the sequences. Therefore, there are a number of methods for correcting
the observed substitution rate for the occurence of multiple
substutions.

<p>

  For nucleotides, the "-position" flag allows the user to choose base
positions to analyse in each codon, i.e. 123 (all bases), 12 (the first
two bases), 1, 2, or 3 individual bases.

<h3>Uncorrected distances</h3>

This method does not make any corrections for multiple substitutions.
Therefore, the score will be an underestimate of the distance between
the sequences. This will not be less significant for highly similar sets
of sequences.

<p>

<pre>
S = m/(npos + gaps*gap_penalty)                                  (1)

m 	    - score of matches (1 for an exact match, a fraction for partial
	      matches and 0 for no match)
npos	    - number of positions included in m
gaps        - number of gaps in the sequences
gap_penalty - the score given to a gapped position
</pre>

<p>

<pre>
D = uncorrected distance = p-distance = 1-S          (2)
</pre>

<p>

The score of match includes all exact matches. For nucleotides, if the
flag "-ambiguous" is used then partial matches are included in the
score. For example, a match of M (A or C) with A will increment m by 0.5
(0.5*1.0). Gaps are not included in the calculation unless a non zero
value is given with "-gapweight". It should be noted that end gaps and
internal gaps will be weighted by the same amount. So it is recommended
that this be used with "-sbegin"and "-send" to specify the start and end
of the region to calculate the distance from.


<h2>Multiple Substitution correction algorithms</h2>


<h3>Jukes-Cantor</h3>


This can be used for nucleotide and protein sequences.

<p>

<pre>
distance = -b ln (1-D/b)

D - uncorrected distance
b - constant. b= 3/4 for nucleotides and 19/20 for proteins.
</pre>

<p>

Partial matches and gap  positions can be taken into account in the
calculation of D, by setting the "-ambiguous" and "-gapweight" flags
(see "uncorrected distance" method).

<h3>Tajima-Nei</h3>

This method is only for nucleotide sequences. It uses the same equation
as Jukes-Cantor, but the b-parameter is not constant. Also, only exact
matches are considered in the calculation of the match score and gap
positions are ignored.

<p>

<pre>
A = 1, T = 2, C = 3, G = 4

b = 0.5(1.- Sum(i=A,G)(fraction[i]^2  + D^2/h)

h = Sum(i=A,C)Sum(k=T,G) (0.5 * pair_frequency[i,k]^2/(fraction[i]*fraction[k]))

distance = -b ln(1.-D/b)

pair_frequency[i,k]   - frequency of the i and k base pair at sites in
			the alignement of the pair of sequences.
fraction[i]           - average content of the base i in both sequences
</pre>

<h3>Kimura Two-Parameter distance</h3>

This method is only for nucleotide sequences. This uses the principle
that transition substitutions (purine-purine and pyrimidine-purine) are
more likely than transversion substitutions (purine-pyprimidine). Purine
being the nucleic acid constituent of A and G, and pyrimidine being the
nucleic acid derivative of the bases C, T and U. Gaps are ignored and
abiguous symbols other than R (purine) and Y (pyrimidine) are ingnored.

<p>

<pre>
P = transitions/npos
Q = transversions/npos

npos - number of positions scored

distance = -0.5 ln[ (1-2P-Q)*sqrt(1-2Q)]
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Tamura</h3>


This method is only for nucleotide sequences.  This method uses
transition and transversion rates and takes into account the deviation
of GC content from the expected value of 50 %. Gap and ambiguous
positions are ignored.

<p>

<pre>
P = transitions/npos
Q = transversions/npos

npos - number of positions scored

GC1 = GC fraction in sequence 1
GC2 = GC fraction in sequence 2
C = GC1 + GC2 - 2*GC1*GC2

distance = -C ln(1-P/C-Q) - 0.5(1-C) ln(1-2Q)
</pre>

<p>

<br>

<h3>Jin-Nei Gamma distance</h3>

This method applies to nucleotides only. This again uses transition and
transversion rates. As with the Kimura two parameter method, gaps and
ambiguous symbols other than R and Y are not oncluded in the score. The
shape parameter, i.e. "a", is the square of the inverse of the
coefficient of variation of the average substitution,

<p>

<pre>
L = average substituition = transition_rate + 2 * transversion_rate
a = (average L)^2/(variance of L)

P = transitions/npos
Q = transversions/npos

npos - number of positions scored

distance = 0.5 * a ((1-2P-Q)^(-1/a) + 0.5 (1-2Q)^(-1/a) -3/2)
</pre>

<p>

It is suggested [Jin et al.], in general, that the distance be
calculated with an a-value of 1. However, the user can specify their own
value, using the "-parametera" option, or calculate for each pair of
sequence, using "-calculatea".

<h3>Kimura Protein distance</h3>

This method is used for proteins only. Gaps are ignored and only exact
matches and ambiguity codes contribute to the match score.

<p>

<pre>
S = m/npos

m  - exact match
npos - number of positions scored

D = 1-S
distance = -ln(1 - D - 0.2D^2)
</pre>
