    Description
</H2>

<b>edialign</b> is an EMBOSS version of the program DIALIGN2 by B.
Morgenstern. It takes as input nucleic acid or protein sequences and
produces as output a multiple sequence alignment. The sequences need
not be similar over their complete length, since the program
constructs alignments from gapfree pairs of similar segments of the
sequences. Such segment pairs are referred to as "diagonals". If
(possibly) coding nucleic acid sequences are to be aligned, <b>edialign</b>
can optionally translate the compared "nucleic acid segments" to
"peptide segments", or even perform comparisons at both nucleic acid
and protein levels, so as to increase the sensitivity of the
comparison.



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

For a complete explanation of the algorithm, see the references. In short :

<p>
As described in our papers, the program DIALIGN constructs alignments
from gapfree pairs of similar segments of the sequences. Such segment
pairs are referred to as "diagonals".  Every possible diagonal is
given a so-called weight reflecting the degree of similarity among the
two segments involved. The overall score of an alignment is then
defined as the sum of weights of the diagonals it consists of and the
program tries to find an alignment with maximum score -- in other
words : the program tries to find a consistent collection of diagonals
with maximum sum of weights. This novel scoring scheme for alignments
is the basic difference between DIALIGN and other global or local
alignment methods. Note that DIALIGN does not employ any kind of gap
penalty.

<p>
It is possible to use a threshold T for the quality of the
diagonals. In this case, a diagonal is considered for alignment only
if its "weight" exceeds this threshold. Regions of lower similarity
are ignored.  In the first version of the program (DIALIGN 1), this
threshold was in many situations absolutely necessary to obtain
meaningful alignments. By contrast, DIALIGN 2 should produce
reasonable alignments without a threshold, i.e. with T = 0. This is
the most important difference between DIALIGN 2 and the first version
of the program. Nevertheless, it is still possible to use a positive
threshold T to filter out regions of lower significance and to include
only high scoring diagonals into the alignment.

<p>
The use of overlap weights improves the sensitivity of the program if
multiple sequences are aligned but it also increases the running time,
especially if large numbers of sequences are aligned. By default,
"overlap weights" are used if up to 35 sequences are aligned but
switched off for larger data sets.

<p>
If (possibly) coding nucleic acid sequences are to be aligned, DIALIGN
optionally translates the compared "nucleic acid segments" to "peptide
segments" according to the genetic code -- without presupposing any of
the three possible reading frames, so all combinations of reading
frames get checked for significant similarity. If this option is used,
the similarity among segments will be assessed on the "peptide level"
rather than on the "nucleic acid level".

<p>
For the levels of sequence similarity, release 2.2 of DIALIGN has two
additional options:

<ul>
<li>
It can  measure the similarity among  segment pairs at  both levels of
similarity (nucleotide-level and  peptide-level similarity). The score
of  a fragment  is  based on  whatever  similarity is  stronger. As  a
result, the program can now produce mixed alignments that contain both
types  of  fragments.  Fragments   with  stronger  similarity  at  the
"nucleotide level"  are referred  to as N-fragments  whereas fragments
with stronger similarity a the peptide level are called P-fragments.

<li>
If the translation or mixed alignment option is used, it is possible
to consider the reverse complements of segments, too. In this case,
both the original segments and their reverse complements are
translated and both pairs of implied "peptide segments" are
compared. This option is useful if DNA sequences contain coding
regions not only on the "Watson strand" but also on the "Crick
strand".

</ul>

The score that DIALIGN assigns to a fragment is based on the
probability to find a fragment of the same respective length and
number of matches (or BLOSUM values, if the translation option is
used) in random sequences of the same length as the input
sequences. If long genomic sequences are aligned, an iterative
procedure can be applied where the program first looks for fragments
with strong similarity. In subsequent steps, regions between these
fragments are realigned. Here, the score of a fragment is based on
random occurrence in these regions between the previously aligned
segment pairs.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>edialign</b> reads nucleotide or protein sequences to be aligned.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/seqinformats.ihtml" -->
<p>

<!--#include file="inc/edialign.input" -->





<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<b>edialign</b> produces two output files with a multiple sequence
alignment. The first one is a file in DIALIGN format and the second
one is a sequence file in any format you choose (by default
fastA).

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/seqinformats.ihtml" -->
<p>
Capital letters denote aligned residues, i.e. residues
involved in at least one of the "diagonals" in the
alignment. Lower-case letters denote residues not belonging to any of
these selected "diagonals". They are not considered to be aligned by
DIALIGN. Thus, if a lower-case letter is standing in the same column
with other letters, this is pure chance ; these residues are not
considered to be homologous.

<p>
Numbers below the alignment reflect the degree of local similarity
among sequences. More precisely, they represent the sum of weights of
fragments connecting residues at the respective position. These
numbers are normalized such that regions of maximum similarity always
get a score of 9 - no matter how strong this maximum simliarity is. In
previous verions of the program, '*' characters were used instead of
numbers ; with the -stars=n option, '*' characters can be used as
previously.

<p>
At the bottom of the file you can find the "guide tree" used to make
the alignment, written in "nested parentheses" format.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


The scoring schemes are hard coded in the program and cannot be
changed. For proteins <b>edialign</b> always uses the BLOSUM62 table.


<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

We strongly recommend to use the "translation" option if nucleic acid
sequences are expected to contain protein coding regions, as it will
significantly increase the sensitivity of the alignment procedure in
such cases.

<p>
If you want to compare long genomic sequences it is recommended to
speed up the algorithm by:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
   setting "Nucleic acid sequence alignment mode" to "mixed alignment"
   (-nucmode=ma)
<li>
   setting "Maximum fragment length" to 30 (-lmax=30)
<li>
   setting "Consider only N-fragment pairs that start with two matches" to yes
   (-fragmat) and setting the similarity score threshold for considering
   P-fragment pairs to 8 (-fragsim=8) (which actually implies that you consider
   only fragments that start with a match).
<li>
   setting the "Threshold" T to 2.0 (-threshold=2.0)
</ul>

<p>
It is also recommended to increase the chance of finding coding exons
by setting "Nucleic acid sequence alignment mode" to "mixed alignment"
(-nucmode=ma) and setting "Also consider the reverse complement"
(-revcomp).

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

Remember that lowercase characters represent parts of the sequence
that are not aligned. You should not use the dialign output as such
for sequence family or phylogeny studies, but take only part of the
alignment and/or remove the lowercase characters using a multiple
sequence editor. The current version of the program has no provision
for doing this automatically.
