<H2>
    Description
</H2>


Protein sequences that form transmembrane regions are assumed to have
a thermodynamic preference for a hydrophobic environment (inside the
membrane lipid bilayer), rather than an aqueous environment in water.

<p>
The free energy change for each amino acid residue between a lipid and
a water environment can be measured experimentally, and the values for
peptides can be shown to be additive (White and Wimley 1999).

<p>
The octanol program calculates two free energy differences.

<p>
The first is the free energy difference between
solution in water and association with the interface (glycerol group) of a
POPC (palmitoyloleoylphosphocholine) bilayer.

<p>
The second is the free energy difference between water and octanol,
equivalent to the environment inside a lipid bilayer.

<p>
Residues which can be buried inside a lipid bilayer must be in a
region of the peptide where most residues show a free energy
difference in favour of being in an octanol environment or at least being
in the lipid/water interface region.

<p>
White and Wimley (1999) showed that a sliding window of either free
energy difference will indicate the location of probably transmembrane
regions, but that the best indicator is the difference between the two
values, which is the free energy difference between the interface and
octanol environments.

<p> The free energies are calculated over a sliding window of 19
residues, about the size of a membrane spanning alphahelix. The energy
values for each residue are added over the window.

    Input file format
</H2>

<b>octanol</b> reads any protein sequence USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/octanol.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<b>octanol</b> draws a graph showing the
free energy calcuated over a sliding window.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/octanol.output" -->

<p>

The line on the default plot is the difference between the interface
and octanol free energy calculations. Command line options allow the
display of the interface and octanol values, or hiding the difference
values.

<p>

In the example, the human opsin protein has 7 transmembrane
regions: 37-61, 74-98, 114-133, 153-176, 203-230, 253-276 and 285-309.
Each is about 20 residues in length, which is also the gap between tick
marks on the sequence axis. All have energetic preferences for being
in the lipid (octanol) enviroment - shown as being above the zero
line - or have at least no clear preference.

<p>

Running octanol with all three plots:

<pre>

% octanol -interface -octanol
Input sequence: tsw:opsd_human
   Graph type [x11]: 

</pre>

gives a graph with the water-interface and water-octanol plots.

<p>

For those regions where the diference plot is close to zero, both the
other two plots are above the line, showing a preference for either
the octanol or the interface membrane environments rather than water.
