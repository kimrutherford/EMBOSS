Description
</H2>

<p><b>etandem</b> identifies tandem repeats in a nucleotide
sequence. It calculates a consensus sequence for a putative repeat
region and scores potential repeats based on the number of matches and
mismatches there are to the consensus. For a repeat to be identified,
it must be within the specified minimum and maximum size and must
score higher than the specified threshold score. The output is a
standard EMBOSS report file with details of the location and score of
any tandem repeats. Optionally, the output can be written in the
format of the Sanger Centre quicktandem program.</p>

<p>Running <b>etandem</b> with a wide range of repeat sizes is
inefficient. It is normally used after <b>equicktandem</b> has been
run to identify putative sizes and locations of repeats.</p>

<H2>
Algorithm
</H2>

<p>The input sequence is first converted so that it contains the
characters <tt>ACGT</tt> or <tt>N</tt> only, i.e. any ambiguity codes
are converted to N.  <b>etandem</b> looks for sequence segments which
match well to a consensus sequence calculated from non-overlapping
windows over the sequence.  For a given start point in the sequence
and repeat size, a consensus sequence is built from contiguous
sequence segments of that size.</p>

<p>The score for a segment (except the first segment which is not
scored) is based on the number of matches and mismatches there are to
the consensus: the score is incremented (+1) for a match and
decremented (-1) for a mismatch.  By default, an "N" can never
mismatch with a nucleotide but this behaviour can be changed with
the <tt>-mismatch</tt> option. The highest scoring segment is kept for
each start position and repeat size.</p>

<p>Immediately adjacent segments that score higher than the specified
threshold score are reported as a tandem repeat. The threshold score
can be set on the command-line using the <tt>-threshold</tt>
qualifier, the default is 20. For perfect repeats, the score is the
equal to the length of the repeat. To allow for mismatches, the
threshold score can be reduced. Each mismatch scores -1 instead of +1
so it scores 2 less than a perfect match of the same number of
bases.</p>

<p>

Running with a wide range of repeat sizes is inefficient. That is why
<b>equicktandem</b> was written - to give a rapid estimate of the major repeat
sizes.
