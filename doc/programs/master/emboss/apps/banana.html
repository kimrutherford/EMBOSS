    Description
</H2>

<p><b>banana</b> predicts bending of a normal (B) DNA double helix,
using the method of Goodsell & Dickerson, NAR 1994
11;22(24):5497-5503.  The program calculates the magnitude of local
bending and macroscopic curvature at each point along an arbitrary
B-DNA sequence, using any desired bending model that specifies values
of twist, roll and tilt as a function of sequence.  The program
outputs both a graphical display and a text file of the results.</p>

<p>The default model (model 'a' from the Goodsell & Dickerson paper)
is based on the nucleosome positioning data of Satchwell et al 1986
(J. Mol. Biol. 191, 659-675).  It correctly predicts experimental
A-tract curvature as measured by gel retardation and cyclization
kinetics and successfully predicts curvature in regions containing
phased <tt>GGGCCC</tt> sequences. The model shows local bending at
mixed sequence DNA, strong bends at the sequence <tt>GGC</tt>, and
straight, rigid A-tracts.  It is the only model out of the six
investigated that is consistent with both solution data from gel
retardation and cyclization kinetics and structural data from x-ray
crystallography.</p>


<H2>
     Algorithm
</H2>
<p><b>banana</b> reads a sequence and a matrix of standard twist, roll
and tilt angles for each type of base pair step. The default matrix is
described below (see "Bending Model") but some other can be specified
(see "Data Files" below).  The program creates a table or a graphical
image of the bending and the curvature at each base step.</p>

<p>The indicated twist, roll and tilt angles are applied at each step
along the sequence, and the resulting base pair normal vector
calculated. The first base pair is aligned normal to the z axis, with
a twist value of 0.0 degrees. The specified twist is applied to the
second base pair, and roll and tilt values are use to calculate its
normal vector relative to the first. If either roll or tilt is
non-zero, the new normal vector will be angled away from the z axis,
producing the first 'bend'. The process is continued along the
sequence, applying the appropriate twist, roll and tilt to each new
base pair relative to its predecessor. The result is a list of normal
vectors for all base pairs in the sequence.</p>

<p>Local bends are then calculated from the normal vectors. The bend
for base N is calculated across a window from N-1 to N+1.</p>

<p>Curvature is calculated in two steps. Base pair normals are first
averaged over a 10-base-pair window to filter out the local writhing
of the helix. The normals of the nine base pairs from N-4 to N+4, and
the two base pairs N-5 and N+5 at half weight, are averaged and
assigned to base pair N. Curvature then is calculated from these
averaged normal vector values, using a bracket value, nc, with a value
of 15. That is, the curvature at base pair N is the angle between
averaged normal vectors at base pairs N-nc and N+nc.</p>


<h3>Bending Model</h3>
<p><b>banana</b> reads by default a data file (Eangles_tri.dat) of
twist, roll and tilt angles, as in Goodsell & Dickerson, NAR 1994
11;22(24):5497-503 and Drew and Travers (1986) JMB 191, 659.  The
roll-tilt-twist parameters of this bending model are objective and
unbiased.  They are derived purely from experimental observations of
sequence location preferences of base trimers in small circles of DNA,
without reference to solution techniques that measure curvature per
se.</p>

<p>Satchwell, Drew and Travers studied the positioning of DNA
sequences wrappped around nucleosome cores, and in closed circles of
double-helical DNA of comparable size. From the sequence data they
calculated a fractional preference of each base pair triplet for a
position 'facing out', or with the major groove on the concave side of
the curved helix.</p>
<p>The sequence GGC, for example, has a 45% preference for locations
on a bent double helix in which its major groove faces inward and is
compressed by the curvature (tending towards positive roll), whereas
sequence AAA has a 36% preference for the opposite orientation, with
major groove facing outward and with minor groove facing inward and
compressed (tending toward negative roll).</p>
<p>These fractional variances are converted into roll angles in the
following manner: Because x-ray cyrstal structure analysis uniformly
indicates that AA steps are unbent, a zero roll is assigned to the AAA
triplet; an arbitrary maximum roll of 10 degrees is asigned to GGC,
and all other triplets are scaled in a lenear manner. Where % is the
percent-out figure, then:

         Roll = 10 degrees * (% + 36)/(45 + 36)
</p>

<p>Changing the maximum roll value will scale the entire profile up or
down proportionately, but will not change the shape of the
profile. Peaks will remain peaks, and valleys, valleys. The absolute
magnitude of all the roll values is less important than their relative
magnitude, or the order of roll preference. Twist angles were set to
zero. Because these values correspond to base trimers, the values of
roll, tilt and twist were applied to the first two bases for the
calculation.</p>

<p>

The description of this bending model is as follows:

<p>

The roll-tilt-twist parameters of this model are derived purely from
experimental observations of sequence location preferences of base
trimers in small circles of DNA, without reference to solution
techniques that measure curvature <i>per se</i>.  For this reason,
they may be the most objective and unbiased parameters of all.
Satchwell, Drew and Travers studied the positioning of DNA sequences
wrappped around nucleosome cores, and in closed circles of
double-helical DNA of comparable size.  From the sequence data they
calculated a fractional preference of each base pair triplet for a
position 'facing out', or with the major groove on the concave side of
the curved helix.  The sequence GGC, for example, has a 45% preference
for locations on a bent double helix in which its major groove faces
inward and is compressed by the curvature (tending towards positive
roll), whereas sequence AAA has a 36% preference for the opposite
orientation, with major groove facing outward and with minor groove
facing inward and compressed (tending toward negative roll).  These
fractional variances have been converted into roll angles in the
following manner: Because x-ray cyrstal structure analysis uniformly
indicates that AA steps are unbent, a zero roll is assigned to the AAA
triplet; an arbitrary maximum roll of 10 degrees is asigned to GGC,
and all other triplets are scaled in a lenear manner.  Where % is the
percent-out figure, then:

<p>

<pre>
         Roll = 10 degrees * (% + 36)/(45 + 36)
</pre>

<p>

Changing the maximum roll value will scale the entire profile up or
down proportionately, but will not change the shape of the profile.
Peaks will remain peaks, and valleys, valleys.  The absolute magnitide
of all the roll values is less important than their relative
magnitude, or the order of roll preference.  Twist angles were set to
zero.  Because these values correspond to base trimers, the values of
roll, tilt and twist were applied to the first two bases for the
calculation.



<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>DNA bending is vital for the winding of DNA in nucleosomes, and the
recognition of particular DNA loci by restriction enzymes, repressors
and other control proteins. For example, the binding of the catabolite
gene activator protein and of the TATA-box recognition protein to a
double DNA helix both rely on major bends in the helix induced at
specific sequence loci. Whether the particular recognition sequences
are bent even in the absence of proteins is not always clear: a
preformed bend in the DNA would form a custom site for protein
binding, or an enhanced bendability of a given sequence would
facilitate protein-induced bending. Sadly, the rules of
sequence-dependent DNA bending remain elusive.</p>

<p>Two models of sequence-dependent bending in free DNA have been
proposed. Nearest neighbor models propose that large-scale measurable
curvature may arise by the accumulation of many small local
deformations in helical twist, roll, tilt and slide at individual
steps between base pairs. In contrast, junction models propose that
bending occurs at the interface between two different structural
variants of the B-DNA double helix.</p>
<p>In both models, sequences which are anisotropically bendable - for
instance, sequences with steps that preferentially bend only to
compress the major groove - will lead to an average structure which is
similar to a sequence with a rigid, intrinsic bend. The default
bending model (see below) used by <b>banana</b> does not distinguish
between these two possibilities.</p>

<p>B-DNA has the special property of having its base pairs very nearly
perpendicular to the overall helix axis. Hence the normal vector to
each base pair can be taken as representing the local helix at that
point, and curvature and bending can be studied simply by observing
the behaviour of the normal vectors from one base to another along the
helix. This is both easy to calculate and simple to interpret. This
program display the magnitude of bending and curvature at each point
along the sequence. It is not intended as a substitute for more
elaborate three-dimensional trajectory calculations, but only to
express bending tendencies as a function of sequence. This affords
easy screening for regions of a given DNA sequence where phased local
bends add constructively to form an overall curve.</p>

<p>The terms bending and curvature are used in a restricted sense
here. Bending of DNA describes the tendency for successive base pairs
to be non-parallel in an additive manner over several base pair
steps. Bending most commonly is produced by a rolling of adjacent base
pairs over one another about thir long axis, although in principle,
tilting of base pairs about their short axis could make a
contribution. In contrast curvature of DNA represents the tendency of
the helix axis to follow a non-linear pathway over an appreciable
length, in a manner that contributes to macroscopic behaviour such as
gel retardation or ease of cyclization into DNA minicircles.</p>

<p>The distinction between local bending and macroscopic curvature is
illustrated (poorly) in the following figure (see figure 1 of the
Goodsell & Dickerson paper for a better view).</p>

</pre>

<p>X-ray crystal structure analysis cannot show curvature, but can and
often does show local bending. Conversely, gel electrophoresis and
cyclization kinetics can detect macroscopic curvature, but not
bending. A complete knowledge of local bending would permit the
precise calculation of curvature, but a knowledge of macroscopic
curvature alone does not allow one to specify precisely the local
bending elements that produce it. This paradox has plagued the DNA
conformation field resembles the familiar problem of classical
statistical mechanics, where a complete knowledge of positions and
velocities of all molecules of a gas would allow one to calculate bulk
properties such as temperature, pressure and volume, but knowledge of
bulk properties cannot lead one to precise molecular positions. Many
molecular arrangements can produce identical bulk properties, and in
the present case, many bending combinations can produce identical
macroscopic curvature.</p>

<p>The consensus sequence for DNA bending is 5 As and 5 non-As
alternating. "N" is an ambiguity code for any base, and "B" is the
ambiguity code for "not A" so "BANANA" is itself a bent sequence -
hence the name of this program.</p>
