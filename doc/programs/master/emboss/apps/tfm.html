<H2>
    Description
</H2>

This program displays the help documentation for an EMBOSS program.
<P>

The contributors of the EMBOSS programs do attempt to provide an adequate
description of the programs. This documentation for your current
release is included as HTML pages in the EMBOSS distribution and
may be available at your site. The
latest documentation for the next release is provided by the
developers at
<A HREF="/apps/">http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/</A>

<P>
The release documentation is also available however through the program
<B>tfm</B> as normal text.

<P>

If you have problems understanding the function
or usage of an EMBOSS program, then you should contact the EMBOSS mailing
list (emboss@emboss.open-bio.org).

<P>

The unusual name of this program comes from the common computing science
expression: <b>RTFM</B>. This acronym, as you probably already know, stands for
<B>Read The Fine* Manual</B>; so this is <B>The Fine* Manual</B>.

<P>

* Insert the expletive of your choice here!

<H3>Paged text output to the screen</H3>

<B>tfm</B> is unusual for an EMBOSS program in that it expects to be used
interactively and so it displays the documentation text a page at a time,
pausing after every page for the user to press the <B>SPACE</B> bar on
their keyboard. (i.e. it uses the UNIX program <B>more</B> to display the
information). This behaviour can be turned off by using the qualifier
<b>-nomore</b>.

<P>

The text is paged to the screen using the UNIX program 'more'.  The
program 'more' is a very standard way for text files to be displayed in
UNIX.  You might, however, prefer the text to be displayed using other
programs, for example 'less' (which has more functionality than 'more'
and is used by many people).  The UNIX environment variable 'PAGER'
can be set to hold the name of your preferred program.  If you have
PAGER set, then <b>tfm</b> will use this specified program instead of
using the default 'more' program.  (If you want <b>tfm</b> to use a
specified program that is different to the normal 'PAGER' program, then
'PAGER' can be overriden by setting the environment variable
'EMBOSS_PAGER' to hold the name of the program that should only be used
to display text in <b>tfm</b>). 

<p>

'PAGER' can be set in UNIX by a command like:
<br>
setenv PAGER less

<p>

To get help on 'more' when using it to display text, press the '?' key.
<BR>
To get help on 'less' when using it to display text, press the 'h' key.

    Usage

<!--#include file="inc/tfm.usage" -->


<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
<!--#include file="inc/tfm.ihelp" -->

</td></tr></table>
<P>
<!--#include file="inc/tfm.itable" -->


<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

None.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/tfm.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

Text documentation is output.

<P>

The table of command line arguments can be a bit difficult to read. This is the
result of changing HTML Web pages to text.

<p>

You will see a page of documentation on the <b>wossname</B> program.
To see further pages, you should press the <B>SPACE</B> bar on your keyboard.
To stop seeing the documentation before you get to the end of the text, you
can press the key <b>q</b> to quit.
