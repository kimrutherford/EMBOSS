<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><B>Dan</B> calculates the melting temperature (Tm) and the percentage of G+C nucleotides for windows over a nucleic acid sequence, optionally plotting them.  If a plot is not being produced, <b>dan</b> reports the sequence of each oligomer window, its melting temperature under the specified conditions and its percentage GC content.  The change in enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and Gibbs free energy (S) for dissociation of the oligomers may (optionally) be reported to file (but not plotted).</p>

<H2>
Algorithm
</H2>

<p>The values of melting point and other thermodynamic properties of the sequence, namely change in enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and Gibbs free energy (S) on dissociation, are calculated for a sequence region (or "window") of a user-specified size (see "-windowsize" option).  The window is incrementally moved along the sequence with the properties being calculated at each new position.  The user must provide the salt and DNA concentration. Optionally, the percent formamide, percent of mismatches allowed and product length may be specified.
<p>For the Melting temperature profile, free energy values calculated from nearest neighbor thermodynamics are used (Breslauer et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 3746-3750 and Baldino et al. Methods in Enzymol. 168, 761-777).</p>

Any DNA or RNA sequence USA.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

If a plot is not being produced, dan reports the sequence of each
oligomer window, its melting temperature under the specified conditions
and its GC content. 

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml" -->
<p>

By default <b>dan</b> writes a 'seqtable' report file.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/dan.output" -->
<p>

The header information contains details of the program, date and sequence

<p>
Subsequent lines contain columns of data for each window into the
sequence as it is moved along, giving:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The start postion of the window
<li> The end position of the window
<li> The melting temperature of the window
<li> The percentage C+G of the window
<li> The sequence of the window
</ul>


<p>

If the qualifier '-product' is used to make the program prompt for
percent formamide percent of mismatches allowed and product length, then
the output includes the melting temperature of the specified product.

<p>

If the qualifier '-thermo' is gived then the DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS
of the sequence in the window is also output.

    Data files
</H2>


The EMBOSS data files "Edna.melt" and "Erna.melt" are used to read in the
entropy/enthalpy/energy data for DNA and RNA respectively.

    Notes
</H2>

<p>The enthalpy of a reaction equates to the "heat" of the reaction so long as temperate and pressure are constant.  Enthalpy depends upon the strength of the chemical bonds and non-bonding interactions involved.  The entropy of a reaction reflects the level of disorder or randomness of the molecules involved. The higher the entropy, the greater the disorder.  The free energy of a reaction reflects it's ability to do work.  It helps one determine whether a reaction is feasible given a set of conditions and it's quilibrium.</p>

RNA sequences must be submited to this application with the '-rna'
qualifier on the command line, otherwise the sequence will be assumed to
be DNA.
