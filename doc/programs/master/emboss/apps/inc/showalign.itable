The reference sequence is always show in full and is the one against which all the other sequences are compared.

<td>Regions to put in uppercase.
If this is left blank, then the sequence case is left alone.
A set of regions is specified by a set of pairs of positions.
The positions are integers.
They are separated by any non-digit, non-alpha character.
Examples of region specifications are:

If the margin is set to a value that is less than the length of a sequence name then the sequence name is displayed truncated to the length of the margin. If the margin is set to -1 then the minimum margin width that will allow all the sequence names to be displayed in full plus a space at the end of the name will automatically be selected.</td>

If this is left blank, then the sequence is left alone.
A set of regions is specified by a set of pairs of positions.
The positions are integers.
They are followed by any valid HTML font colour.
Examples of region specifications are:
24-45 blue 56-78 orange
1-100 green 120-156 red
A file of ranges to colour (one range per line) can be specified as '@filename'.</td>
