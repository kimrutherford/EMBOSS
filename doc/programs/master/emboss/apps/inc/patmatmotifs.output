# 
# Visual pigments [1,2] are the light-absorbing  molecules that  mediate vision.
# They consist of  an apoprotein, opsin,  covalently  linked  to the chromophore
# cis-retinal.  Vision is  effected through  the absorption of a  photon by cis-
# retinal  which is isomerized to  trans-retinal.  This isomerization leads to a
# change  of conformation  of the protein. Opsins are integral membrane proteins
# with  seven transmembrane regions that belong to family 1 of G-protein coupled
# receptors (see &lt;PDOC00210&gt;).
# 
# In vertebrates four different pigments are generally found.   Rod cells, which
# mediate vision in dim light, contain the pigment rhodopsin.  Cone cells, which
# function in bright light, are responsible  for  color vision and contain three
# or more color pigments (for example, in mammals: red, blue and green).
# 
# In Drosophila, the  eye   is composed   of 800   facets  or   ommatidia.  Each
# ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-R8):  the R1 to R6 cells are
# outer cells,  R7  and R8 inner cells. Each of the three types of cells (R1-R6,
# R7 and R8) expresses a specific opsin.
# 
# Proteins evolutionary related to opsins include squid retinochrome, also known
# as retinal  photoisomerase, which converts various isomers of retinal into 11-
# cis retinal and mammalian retinal pigment  epithelium (RPE) RGR [3], a protein
# that may also act in retinal isomerization.
# 
# The attachment  site  for  retinal in the above proteins is a conserved lysine
# residue in  the  middle  of  the  seventh  transmembrane helix. The pattern we
# developed includes this residue.

# -Consensus pattern: [LIVMWAC]-[PGAC]-x(3)-[SAC]-K-[STALIMR]-[GSACPNV]-[STACP]-
#                     x(2)-[DENF]-[AP]-x(2)-[IY]
#                     [K is the retinal binding site]
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
# -Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.
