<!--#include file="inc/transeq.ione" -->


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>Transeq</b> translates nucleic acid sequences to the corresponding
peptide sequence.
<p>
It can translate in any of the 3 forward or three reverse sense
frames, or in all three forward or reverse frames, or in all six
frames.
<p>
It can translate specified regions corresponding to the coding
regions of your sequences. 
<p>
It can translate using the standard ('Universal') genetic code
and also with a selection of non-standard codes. 
<p>
Termination (STOP) codons are translated as the character '*'.
<p>
The output peptide sequence is always in the standard one-letter
IUPAC code.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>
<b>transeq</b> reads one or more nucleic acid sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/transeq.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/transeq.output" -->

<p>

One or more peptide sequences are written out.

<p>

The names of the resulting protein sequences are formed from the name of
the input nucleic acid sequence with '_' and the translation frame
appended to it.  Thus a nucleic acid sequence with the name 'XYZ'
franslated in all 6 frame would produce protein sequences with the
names: 'XYZ_1', 'XYZ_2', 'XYZ_3', 'XYZ_4', 'XYZ_5', 'XYZ_6'. 

<p>

If regions are specified, they are taken to be translated in frame 1 and
so the output name would be 'XYZ_1'.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

The reverse frame '-1' is defined as the translation you get when you
use the reverse-complement of the sequence with the same codon phase as
the codon in frame '1'. 

<p>

Thus the sequence ACTGG in frame 1 is the translation of the codons
ACT,GG; the translation of frame -1 uses these same codons, reverse
complemented:

<p>

<pre>
  forward sense          ACT GG
  reverse sense          TGA CC

  reverse-complement     CC AGT
  frame -1 translation       S
</pre>

<p>

Frame -1 is the translation of CCAGT (the reverse complement of ACTGG)
using the codon 'AGT' (the first bases 'CC' are ignored).  The result is
the peptide 'S'. 

<p>

Similarly frame -2 is the phase used by frame 2, 'CAG T' (the first base
'C' is ignored). The last base cannot be successfully translated and is
output as the unknown residue 'X'. The result is the peptide 'QX'.

<p>

Frame -3 is the phase used by frame 3, 'CCA GT'.  The last two bases
will translate to 'V' as it does not matter what the next base is. 
(GTA, GTC, GTG, GTT all code for 'V').  The result is the peptide 'PV'. 

<p>

The alternative way of generating the reverse translation frames used by
some people is that frame -1 is made by taking the frame '1' of the
reverse complement.  There is no correspondence between the codons used
in frame 1 and -1, 2 and -2, 3 and -3; the codons used change with the
length modulus 3. 

<p>

There does not appear to be a convention on which definition to use.
<br>
The Staden package uses the same convention as this program.
<br>
The GCG package sneakily avoids the problem by naming the frames using
letters (a, b, c, d, e, f)

<p>

If you really need to define frame -1 as the frame given when you
reverse complement the sequence and then start translating at the first
frame in the resulting sequence, then use the '-alternative' qualifier.

None.


<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>


	When translating using non-standard genetic code table, always
	check the table carefully for deviations from your particular
	organism's code.

<p>

When using the '-regions' option, you should always leave the '-frames'
option at the default of frame '1'.  If you change the frame while
specifying a region to translate, then the regions will be offset by 1
or 2 bases, which is not what you want. 


<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>


	Several warning messages about malformed region specifications:
<ul>
        <li>Non-digit found in region ...
        <li>Unpaired start of a region found in ...
        <li>Non-digit found in region ...
        <li>The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
                end in ... 
</ul>
<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>


	It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.
