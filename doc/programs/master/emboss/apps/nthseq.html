<H2>
    Description
</H2>


<p><b>nthseq</b> writes to file a single sequence from an input stream of sequences. The sequence is specified by number, which is the order it appears in the input file. The output file name may be specified.</p>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>nthseq</b> reads one or more nucleotiode or protein sequences.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/seqformats.ihtml" -->

<p>
The output is the specified ordinal sequence from the input USA.

<p>

In the example, the second sequence from the input file will be written
out to the specified output file.

    Data files
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>In EMBOSS, when an application has to write out many sequences, they are typically all written to a single file.  This default behaviour can be changed by using the qualifier <tt>-ossingle</tt> which forces each sequence to be written to its own file.</p>

<p>The program <b>seqretsplit</b> will take a file containing many sequences and will output many files, each containing one sequence. However you have no choice over the naming of the files - they are named after the ID name fo the sequence they contain.</p>


<p>
It may be useful to use this application in a small script that extracts
all sequences from a multiple sequence file and explicitly names the
output files in the way that you require. 

<p>
For example:

<p>

<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
if ($#ARGV !=1) {
  die "Usage: scriptname in out\n";
}
$count=1;
@list = `infoseq $ARGV[0] -auto -only -name`;
while ($count &lt;= $#list+1) {
  system("nthseq -auto $ARGV[0] -n $count $ARGV[1]-$count.seq");
  $count++;
}
</pre>
