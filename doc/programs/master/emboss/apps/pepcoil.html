<H2>
    Description
</H2>


<p><b>pepcoil</b> calculates the probability of a coiled-coil structure for windows of (by default) 28  residues through a protein sequence using the method of Lupas A, van Dyke M & Stock J (1991); Science 252:1162-4.  It reads one or more sequences and writes a standard EMBOSS report file including the location and score of the putative coiled-coil structures and their score for each input sequence.  Optionally, coiled coil regions, non-coiled coil regions and coil frameshifts are reported.</p>

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>Coiled coils are formed by two or three alpha helices in parallel and in register that cross at an angle of approximately 20 degrees, are strongly amphipathic and display a pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues that is repeated every seven residues. The seven positions of the heptad repeat are designated a through g, a and d being generally hydrophobic, while the others are hydrophilic.</p>

<p>The parallel two-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil is the most frequently encountered subunit-oligomerization motif in proteins.</p>
