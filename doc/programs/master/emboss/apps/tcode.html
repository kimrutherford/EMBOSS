<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>tcode</b> tests DNA sequences for protein coding regions using an
algorithm which looks for simple and universal differences between
protein-coding and noncoding DNA.The original paper reports that the
test had been thoroughly proven on 400,000 bases of sequence data: it
misclassifies 5% of the regions tested and gives an answer of "No
Opinion" one fifth of the time. 

<p>

The program slides a window of user-selectable size over the DNA
sequence. For each window the TESTCODE statistic is applied. The
results can be output as a text report or displayed graphically.  The
text output reports each window as "Coding", "Noncoding" or "No
opinion". Entries marked "No opinion" have a TESTCODE value that falls
between the maximum and minimum values required to report a region as
noncoding or coding. For the graphical plot, all points above a green
horizontal line are determined to be coding regions. Those below a red
line are determined to be noncoding.  Points between the red and green
lines are "no opinion" ones.


<H2>
    Biological Relevance
</H2>  

The statistic reflects the fact that codons are used with unequal
frequency and that oligonucleotides and nucleotides tend to be
repeated with a periodicity of three.

<p>

This application can assist in determining the probability of a region of
nucleic sequence encoding a functional protein.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The Fickett (1982) algorithm is used (1).

<p>

A window of at least 200 bases is moved over the sequence in steps of 3 bases

<p>

Let:

<p>

<pre>
  A1 = Number of A's in positions 1,4,7 ...
  A2 = Number of A's in positions 2,5,8 ...
  A3 = Number of A's in positions 3,6,9 ...
</pre>

<p>

A position value is determined that reflects the degree to which
each base is favoured in one codon position over another, i.e.

<p>

<pre>
  Apos = MAX(A1,A2,A3) / MIN(A1,A2,A3)+1
</pre>

<p>

This is done for all 4 bases. The percentage composition of each base
is also determined. Eight values are therefore determined, four
position values and four composition values. These are then converted
to probabilities (p) of coding using a look-up table provided as the data
file for the program. The values in this look-up table have been
determined experimentally using known coding and noncoding sequences.

<p>

Each of the probabilities is multiplied by a weight (w) value
(again from the look-up table) for the respective base. The weight value
reflects the percentage of the time that each parameter alone successfully
predicted coding or noncoding function for the sequences of known function.

<p>

The TESTCODE statistic is then:

<p>

<pre>
  p1w1 + p2w2 + p3w3 + p4w4 + p5w5 + p6w6 + p7w7 + p8w8
</pre>

<p>

A result of less than 0.74 is probably a non-coding region.

<br>

A result equal or greater than 0.95 is probably a coding region.

<br>

Anything in between these two values is uncertain.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>tcode</b> reads any normal sequence USAs.

<p>

The program will ignore ambiguity codes in the nucleic acid sequence and 
just accept the four common bases. This is a function of the algorithm, 
and the data tables. 

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/tcode.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml" -->

<p>

<b>tcode</b> 
outputs a report format file. The default format is 'table'.
<p>

The resulting report file will be given a name relating to the analysed
sequence together with the .tcode suffix by default.  Should there be no
sequence description, the default reverts to outfile.tcode. 

<p>

<b>tcode</b> optionally
outputs a graph to the specified graphics device. 

<p>

The graphical display is output with the default file name tcode.1.  and
then the name of the selected graphical display (e.g.  png; ps).

<p>

The graph indicates the threshold for probably being coding with a green
horizontal line and the threshold for probably not being coding with a
red horizontal line. 

<p>

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/localfiles.ihtml" -->

<p>

The default data file (look-up table) is Etcode.dat which contains the
data from the original paper (1)

<p>

This file is retrievable using EMBOSSDATA.

<p>

Window size is set by default to 200.  The algorithm requires sufficient
sequence to perform the statistic on.  The original paper suggests a
minimum window size of 200. 

<p>

Window stepping increment is set by default to 3. This will ensure the resulting
information remains in frame.


<h3>
    Alternative Data Files

There are no alternative data files currently in the EMBOSS Data directory, but
alternative values may be user defined. 



<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

In the GCG package, the current (version 10.3) TESTCODE application's apparent
interpretation of the algorithm is:

<p>

<pre>
	MAX(A1,A2,A3) / MIN(A1,A2,A3)
</pre>

<p>

The EMBOSS <b>tcode</b> program uses the correct Fickett algorithm equation:

<p>

<pre>
	MAX(A1,A2,A3) / MIN(A1,A2,A3) + 1
</pre>

thus any plot using the GCG TESTCODE aplication will be slightly higher
than the <b>tcode</b> equivalent.
