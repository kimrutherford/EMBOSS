    Function
</H2>
Report restriction enzyme cleavage sites in a nucleotide sequence

<H2>
    Description
</H2>


<p><b>restrict</b> scans one or more nucleotide sequences for cut sites for a supplied set of restriction enzymes.  One or more restriction enzymes can be specified or alternatively all the enzymes in the REBASE database can be investigated.  The minimum length of a recognition site to be reported must be specified. It writes an output file showing the location of the cut sites. There are several options to control exactly what sites are reported and the format of the output file. Optionally, the fragment lengths of the forward sense strand produced by complete restriction by each restriction enzyme on its own, or by using all of the input enzymes together, may be reported. Results are added to the tail section of the report.</p>

Report restriction enzyme cleavage sites in a nucleotide sequence
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -sitelen            integer    [4] This sets the minimum length of the
                                  restriction enzyme recognition site. Any
                                  enzymes with sites shorter than this will be
                                  ignored. (Integer from 2 to 20)
   -enzymes            string     [all] The name 'all' reads in all enzyme
                                  names from the REBASE database. You can
                                  specify enzymes by giving their names with
                                  commas between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:
                                  ! my enzymes
                                  HincII, ppiII
                                  ! other enzymes
                                  hindiii
                                  HinfI
                                  PpiI (Any string)
  [-outfile]           report     [*.restrict] Output report file name
                                  (default -rformat table)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -datafile           datafile   Restriction enzyme data file (optional)
   -mfile              datafile   [Emethylsites.dat] Restriction enzyme
                                  methylation data file
   -min                integer    [1] This sets the minimum number of cuts for
                                  any restriction enzyme that will be
                                  considered. Any enzymes that cut fewer times
                                  than this will be ignored. (Integer from 1
                                  to 1000)
   -max                integer    [2000000000] This sets the maximum number of
                                  cuts for any restriction enzyme that will
                                  be considered. Any enzymes that cut more
                                  times than this will be ignored. (Any
                                  integer value)
   -solofragment       boolean    [N] This gives the fragment lengths of the
                                  forward sense strand produced by complete
                                  restriction by each restriction enzyme on
                                  its own. Results are added to the tail
                                  section of the report.
   -single             boolean    [N] If this is set then this forces the
                                  values of the mincuts and maxcuts qualifiers
                                  to both be 1. Any other value you may have
                                  set them to will be ignored.
   -[no]blunt          boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  the same position on the forward and reverse
                                  strands to be considered.
   -[no]sticky         boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  different positions on the forward and
                                  reverse strands, leaving an overhang, to be
                                  considered.
   -[no]ambiguity      boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which have one
                                  or more 'N' ambiguity codes in their
                                  pattern to be considered
   -plasmid            boolean    [N] If this is set then this allows searches
                                  for restriction enzyme recognition site and
                                  cut positions that span the end of the
                                  sequence to be considered.
   -methylation        boolean    [N] If this is set then RE recognition sites
                                  will not match methylated bases.
   -[no]commercial     boolean    [Y] If this is set, then only those enzymes
                                  with a commercial supplier will be searched
                                  for. This qualifier is ignored if you have
                                  specified an explicit list of enzymes to
                                  search for, rather than searching through
                                  'all' the enzymes in the REBASE database. It
                                  is assumed that, if you are asking for an
                                  explicit enzyme, then you probably know
                                  where to get it from and so all enzymes
                                  names that you have asked to be searched
                                  for, and which cut, will be reported whether
                                  or not they have a commercial supplier.
   -[no]limit          boolean    [Y] This limits the reporting of enzymes to
                                  just one enzyme from each group of
                                  isoschizomers. The enzyme chosen to
                                  represent an isoschizomer group is the
                                  prototype indicated in the data file
                                  'embossre.equ', which is created by the
                                  program 'rebaseextract'. If you prefer
                                  different prototypes to be used, make a copy
                                  of embossre.equ in your home directory and
                                  edit it. If this value is set to be false
                                  then all of the input enzymes will be
                                  reported. You might like to set this to
                                  false if you are supplying an explicit set
                                  of enzymes rather than searching 'all' of
                                  them.
   -alphabetic         boolean    [N] Sort output alphabetically
   -fragments          boolean    [N] This gives the fragment lengths of the
                                  forward sense strand produced by complete
                                  restriction using all of the input enzymes
                                  together. Results are added to the tail
                                  section of the report.

    Input file format
</H2>


<b>restrict</b> reads one or more nucleotide sequences.
<p>
<p>

The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA').

<p>
Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

<p>

Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

<p>
The input format can be specified by using the
command-line qualifier <tt>-sformat xxx</tt>, where 'xxx' is replaced
by the name of the required format.  The available format names are:
gff (gff3), gff2, embl (em), genbank (gb, refseq), ddbj, refseqp, pir
(nbrf), swissprot (swiss, sw), dasgff and debug.

<p>

See:

<p>

The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. 

<p>

The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <tt>-rformat xxx</tt>, where 'xxx' is replaced
by the name of the required format.  The available format names are:
embl, genbank, gff, pir, swiss, dasgff, debug, listfile, dbmotif,
diffseq, draw, restrict, excel, feattable, motif, nametable, regions,
seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq.

The output from restrict is a simple text one. The base number,
restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are
shown. Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue
shown and that 5' cuts are referred to by their associated 3'
number sequence.

<p>

The program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites. The
program also reports isoschizomers and enzymes having the same
recognition sequence but different cut sites.


<p>

When the "-fragments" or "-solofragments" qualifiers are given then the sizes of
the fragments produced by either all of the specified enzymes cutting, or
by each enzyme cutting individually, are given in the 'tail' section
at the end of the report file.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>
<p>
The EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files are stored in
directory 'data/REBASE/*' under the EMBOSS installation directory.

<p>

These files must first be set up using the program <a
href="rebaseextract.html">'<b>rebaseextract</b>'</a>.  Running
'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.

<p>
      
The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard EMBOSS
data directory. The names are:

<ul>
<li> embossre.enz     Cleavage information
<li> embossre.ref     Reference/methylation information
<li> embossre.sup     Supplier information
</ul>
	 
The column information is described at the top of the data files
	 
<p>
	 
The reported enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype)
is specified in the REBASE database and the information is held in the
data file 'embossre.equ'.  You may edit this file to set your own
preferred prototype, if you wish. 
	 
<p>
	 
The format of the file "embossre.equ" is
<br>
Enzyme-name Prototype-name
	 
<p>
	 
i.e.  two columns of enzyme names separated by a space.  The first name
of the pair of enzymes is the name that is not preferred and the second
is the preferred (prototype) name. 
	 
	          



<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>Several criteria may be set to control what sites are reported: <tt>-min</tt>, <tt>-max</tt>, <tt>-single</tt> (minimum or maximum number of cuts, or single site cuts only.  <tt>-blunt</tt> (enzymes which cut at the same position on the forward and reverse strands). <tt>-sticky</tt> (enzymes which cut at different positions on the forward and reverse strands, leaving an overhang). <tt>-ambiguity</tt> (enzymes which have one or more <tt>N</tt> ambiguity codes in their pattern).  <tt>-commercial</tt> (enzymes with a commercial supplier). <tt>-plasmid</tt> (allows searches for restriction enzyme recognition site and cut postions that span the end of the sequence).</p>

<p>By default, only one enzyme of any group of isoschizomers (enzymes that have the same recognition site and cut positions) is reported. This behaviour can be changed by specifying <tt>-nolimit</tt>, in which case all isoschizomers are reported.  The default behaviour uses the representative enzyme of an isoschizomer group (the prototype) which is specified in the EMBOSS data file <tt>embossre.equ</tt>.  This file is generated from the REBASE database by running <b>rebaseextract</b>. You may edit this file to set your own preferred prototype,if you wish.</p> 

<p>Output file size is related to the size of the recognition site and the maximum number of allowed cutting positions. Setting the site length to six and restricting the cuts to two is a common choice of parameters. The size of the output can sometimes be reduced by specifying the <tt>-noambiguity</tt> switch.</p>
