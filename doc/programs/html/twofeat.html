    Function
</H2>
Finds neighbouring pairs of features in sequence(s)
<H2>
    Description
</H2>



<p><b>twofeat</b> finds neighbouring pairs of specified features in one or more input sequences. Each feature may be specified by type, name, sense, score, tag/value pairs etc.  Their relationship, e.g. their sequence separation or overlap, relative sense and order may also be specified. It writes a standard EMBOSS report file with any such feature pairs identified.  By default each pair is written as a single feature but (optionally) they are written in their original form.</p>



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<p>For each of the pair of features, you can specify its type name, its sense, its score and any tag/value pairs, amongst other things.</p></p>

<p>You can then specify the type of relationship that the two features should have as follows:</p>

<p>Minimum and maximum distance between each feature. </p>
<p>Distance measurement (measure from the nearest ends of the two features, from the left ends, from right ends, from the furthest ends.)</p>
<p>Type of overlap (any type of overlap or no overlap is allowed, Overlap required, No overlaps are allowed, Overlap required but one feature must not be completely within the other, Feature A must be completely enclosed within feature B, Feature B must be completely enclosed within feature A). </p>
<p>Feature sense (any sense, in the same sense or in opposite senses)</p>
<p>Feature order (any order, Feature A then feature B, Feature B then feature A)</p>

<p>The program proceeds as follows.  For eachs sequence:
	Identify the features that match the criteria for Feature A
	Identify the features that match the criteria for Feature B
	Compare all pairs of features
	If they satisfy the requirements output them to the report file</p>

<p>By default the resulting pairs of features found are then written to a report file as a single feature from the first postion of the left-most feature to the last position of the right-most feature. You can modify the output to report the pairs of features with no changes made to them.</p> 



<H2>
    Usage
</H2>
Here is a sample session with <b>twofeat</b>
<p>
Without the -twoout option the output report contains just one feature for every pair of features found. 
<p>

<p>
<table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#CCFFFF"><pre>

<b>Example 2</b>
<p>
The -twoout option makes the output report give the pairs of features found. The output report format type has been changed to display the full original pairs of features in GFF format.

                                  feature table is allowed. You can set this
                                  to match any feature source you wish to
                                  allow.
                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the
                                  feature came from.
                                  The source may be wildcarded by using '*'.

                                  feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may
                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',
                                  '/db_xref', '/EC_number', '/evidence',

                                  '/usedin'. Some of these tags also have
                                  values, for example '/gene' can have the
                                  value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag in the feature
                                  table is allowed. You can set this to match
                                  any feature tag you wish to allow.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.

   -avalue             string     [*] Tag values are the values associated
                                  with a feature tag. Tags are the types of
                                  extra values that a feature may have. For
                                  example in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS'
                                  type of feature may have the tags '/codon',

                                  these tags can have values, for example
                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the

                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the
                                  feature table is allowed. You can set this

                                  If you wish to allow more than one tag
                                  value, separate their names with the

   -overlap            menu       [A] This allows you to specify the allowed
                                  overlaps of the features A and B.
                                  You can allow any or no overlaps, specify
                                  that they must or must not overlap, that one
                                  must or must not be wholly enclosed within
                                  another feature. (Values: A (Any); O

                                  allowed); NW (Overlap required but not
                                  within); AW (A must be all within B); BW (B
                                  must be all within A))
   -rangetype          menu       [N] This allows you to specify the positions
                                  from which the allowed minimum or maximum
                                  distance between the features is measured
                                  (Values: N (From nearest ends); L (From left
                                  ends); R (From right ends); F (From
                                  furthest ends))
   -sense              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  sense that the two features must be on. This
                                  is ignored (always 'Any') when looking at
                                  protein sequence features. (Values: A (Any
                                  sense); S (Same sense); O (Opposite sense))
   -order              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  order of the two features. The order is
                                  measured from the start positions of the
                                  features. This criterion is always applied
                                  despite the specified overlap type required.
                                  (Values: A (Any); AB (Feature A then
                                  feature B); BA (Feature B then feature A))
   -twoout             toggle     [N] If you set this to be true, then the two
                                  features themselves will be written out. If
                                  it is left as false, then a single feature
                                  will be written out covering the two
                                  features you found.
*  -typeout            string     [misc_feature] If you have specified that
                                  the pairs of features that are found should
                                  be reported as one feature in the ouput,
                                  then you can specify the 'type' name of the
                                  new feature here. By default every feature
                                  in the feature table is allowed. See
                                  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/WebFeat/ for a

    Input file format
</H2>

<p>

The input is a standard EMBOSS sequence query (also known as a 'USA')
with associated feature information.

<p>
Major sequence database sources defined as standard in EMBOSS
installations include srs:embl, srs:uniprot and ensembl

<p>

Data can also be read from sequence output in any supported format
written by an EMBOSS or third-party application.

<p>
The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
<tt>-sformat xxx</tt>, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the
required format.  The available format names are: text, html, xml (uniprotxml),
obo, embl (swissprot)

<p> Where the sequence format has no feature information, a second
file can be read to load the feature data. The file is specified with
the qualifier <tt>-ufo xxx</tt> and the feature format is specified with
the qualifier <tt>-fformat xxx</tt>

<p>
See:
<A href="http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/SequenceFormats.html">
