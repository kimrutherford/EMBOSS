<H2>
    Function
</H2>
Finds neighbouring pairs of features in sequences
<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>twofeat</b> reads in the feature tables of sequences and reports
occurances of pairs of specified features. 

<p>

This is intended for use as a simple data-mining tool to enable you to
look for instances of pairs of features that occur near to each other in
the same sequence entry. 

<p>

For each of the pair of features, you can specify its type name, its
sense, its score and any tag/value pairs, amongst other things. 

<p>

You can then specify the type of relationship that the two features
should have.  You can specify the minimum and maximum distance between
them.  You can specify the type of overlap allowed: Any type of overlap
or no overlap is allowed, Overlap required, No overlaps are allowed,
Overlap required but one feature must not be completely within the
other, Feature A must be completely enclosed within feature B, Feature B
must be completely enclosed within feature A.  You can specify that the
distance should be measured from the nearest ends of the two features,
From the left ends, From right ends, From the furthest ends.  You can
specify that the features should be in any sense, in the same sense or
in opposite senses.  You can specify that the features should be in any
order, Feature A then feature B, Feature B then feature A. 

<p>

By default the resulting pairs of features found are then written to a
report file as a single feature from the first postion of the left-most
feature to the last position of the right-most feature.  You can modify
the output to report the pairs of features with no changes made to them. 

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<pre>
For each sequence:
	identify the features that match the criteria for Feature A
	identify the features that match the criteria for Feature B
	compare all pairs of features
	if they satisfy the requirements output them to the report file
</pre>


<H2>
    Usage
</H2>
<b>Here is a sample session with twofeat</b>
<p>
Without the -twoout option the output report contains just one feature for every pair of features found. 
<p>

<p>
The -twoout option makes the output report give the pairs of features found. The output report format type has been changed to display the full original pairs of features in GFF format.

                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the

                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',

                                  '/transl_table', or '/usedin'. Only some of
                                  these tags can have values, for example
                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the
                                  feature table is allowed. You can set this
                                  to match any feature tag value you wish to
                                  allow.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.
                                  If you wish to allow more than one tag
                                  value, separate their names with the
                                  character '|', eg:
                                  pax* | 10 (Any string is accepted)
   -overlap            menu       [A] This allows you to specify the allowed
                                  overlaps of the features A and B.
                                  You can allow any or no overlaps, specify
                                  that they must or must not overlap, that one
                                  must or must not be wholly enclosed within
                                  another feature. (Values: A (Any); O
                                  (Overlap required); NO (No overlaps are
                                  allowed); NW (Overlap required but not
                                  within); AW (A must be all within B); BW (B
                                  must be all within A))
   -rangetype          menu       [N] This allows you to specify the positions
                                  from which the allowed minimum or maximum
                                  distance between the features is measured
                                  (Values: N (From nearest ends); L (From left
                                  ends); R (From right ends); F (From
                                  furthest ends))
   -sense              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  sense that the two features must be on. This
                                  is ignored (always 'Any') when looking at
                                  protein sequence features. (Values: A (Any
                                  sense); S (Same sense); O (Opposite sense))
   -order              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  order of the two features. The order is
                                  measured from the start positions of the
                                  features. This criterion is always applied
                                  despite the specified overlap type required.
                                  (Values: A (Any); AB (Feature A then
                                  feature B); BA (Feature B then feature A))
   -twoout             toggle     [N] If you set this to be true, then the two
                                  features themselves will be written out. If
                                  it is left as false, then a single feature
                                  will be written out covering the two
                                  features you found.
*  -typeout            string     [misc_feature] If you have specified that
                                  the pairs of features that are found should
                                  be reported as one feature in the ouput,
                                  then you can specify the 'type' name of the
                                  new feature here. By default every feature
                                  in the feature table is allowed. See
                                  http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/ for
                                  a list of the EMBL feature types and see

                                  list of the Swissprot feature types. If you
                                  specify an invalid feature type name, then
                                  the default name 'misc_feature' is used.

The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. 

<p>

The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <b>-rformat xxx</b>, where 'xxx' is replaced by
the name of the required format.  The available format names are: embl,
genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq
