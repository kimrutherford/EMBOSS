<H2>
    Function
</H2>
Finds programs sharing group names

<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This program takes the name of an existing program in EMBOSS (or a
program in one the associated EMBASSY packages) and gives a list of the
programs which share some functionality with it. 

<p>
It does this by noting the functional groups that the program belongs to
and reporting any programs which share those functional groups.
<p>

The functional groups of a program are set in the ACD file (this is the
part of the program in the EMBOSS system which specifies the required
parameters, some help on the parameters, the one-line description of the
program, etc.) Normally the names of the groups are fairly specific,
such as: "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION", resulting in the reporting of only a
tightly restricted set of other programs also dealing with the analysis
of "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION".  The '-explode' qualifier will increase the
number of groups that the program belongs to by splitting the group name
at selected points to produce such groups as: "NUCLEIC", "NUCLEIC
COMPOSITION" and "COMPOSITION".  All programs with the exploded group
names which also include "NUCLEIC" and "COMPOSITION" will now be
reported.  The result of this qualifier is thus a report of a larger
number of programs with a more tenuous link to the specified program. 
In other words, use the '-explode' qualifier to decrease the specificity
of the search. 

<p>
The groups that the program belongs to can be output by using the
'-groups' qualifier.

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-search]            string     Enter the name of an EMBOSS program (Any
                                  string of at least 1 characters)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -explode            boolean    [N] The groups that EMBOSS applications
                                  belong to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
                                  Using expanded group names will find many
                                  more programs which share at least some of
                                  the expanded names than using the
                                  non-exploded names and so you will get more
                                  programs reported as sharing a similar
                                  function than you will if you specify that
                                  you wish to use non-exploded names
   -outfile            outfile    [stdout] Output file name

                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
   -groups             boolean    [N] If you use this option, then only the
                                  group names will output to the file

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]emboss         boolean    [Y] If you use this option then EMBOSS
                                  program documentation will be searched. If
                                  this option is set to be false, then only
                                  the EMBASSY programs will be searched (if
                                  the -embassy option is true). EMBASSY

                                  the same look and feel, but are generally
                                  developed by people who wish the programs to
                                  be outside of the GNU Public Licence scheme
   -[no]embassy        boolean    [Y] If you use this option then EMBASSY
                                  program documentation will be searched. If
                                  this option is set to be false, then only

                                  -emboss option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the

                                  people who wish the programs to be outside
                                  of the GNU Public Licence scheme

                                  searched. EMBASSY programs are not strictly
                                  part of EMBOSS, but use the same code
                                  libraries and share the same look and feel,
                                  but are generally developed by people who
                                  wish the programs to be outside of the GNU

                                  accepted)
   -colon              boolean    [N] The groups that EMBOSS applications
                                  belong to have up to two levels, for example
                                  the primary group 'ALIGNMENT' has several
                                  sub-groups, or second-level groups, e.g.:
                                  CONSENSUS, DIFFERENCES, DOT PLOTS, GLOBAL,
                                  LOCAL, MULTIPLE. To aid programs that parse

                                  of these subgroups, a colon ':' will be
                                  placed between the first and second level of
                                  the group name if this option is true.
