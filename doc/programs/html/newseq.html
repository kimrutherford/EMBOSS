<H2>
    Function
</H2>
Type in a short new sequence

<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows you to type a sequence into a file in a quick and
easy manner.

<p>
The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a
fairly short length (typically less than 255 characters).  This
length restriction is not a property of the EMBOSS package, but of the
computer system you are using.  This is because, as you type in
response to a prompt from this program, what you type is stored in the
computer operating system before being handed over to the program. 
There is often a limit of less than 255 characters on the length of a
response that a computer system will allow you to give. 

<p>
Despite this restriction, it is expected that this program will
be a useful and easy way of constructing new sequence files. 

<p>
(You wouldn't want to type a long sequence in by hand, anyway,
would you?)

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


<b>Here is a sample session with newseq</b>
<p>
Type in a short sequence to the file 'mycc.pep' in SWISSPROT format: 
<p>

<p>
<table width="90%"><tr><td bgcolor="#CCFFFF"><pre>

% <b>newseq </b>
Type in a short new sequence.
Name of the sequence: <b>cytoc</b>
Description of the sequence: <b>fragment of cytochrome c</b>
Type of sequence
         N : Nucleic
         P : Protein
Type of sequence [N]: <b>p</b>
Enter the sequence: <b>KKKEERADLIAY</b>
output sequence [outfile.fasta]: <b>swiss::mycc.pep</b>

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-name]              string     The name of of the sequence should be a
                                  single word that you will use to identify
                                  the sequence. It should have no (or few)
                                  punctuation characters in it. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
  [-description]       string     Enter any description of the sequence that
                                  you require. (Any string is accepted)

  [-sequence]          string     The sequence itself.
                                  Because of the limitation of the operating
                                  system, you will only be able to type in a
                                  short sequence of (typically) 250
                                  characters, or so.

                                  to press the RETURN/ENTER key until you have
                                  deleted a few characters. (Any string is
