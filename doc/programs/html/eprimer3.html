    Function
</H2>
Picks PCR primers and hybridization oligos
<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>eprimer3</b> is an interface to the 'primer3' program from the
Whitehead Institute. 

<p>

The Whitehead program must be set up and on the path in order for
<b>eprimer3</b> to find and run it. 

<p>

Primer3 picks primers for PCR reactions, considering as criteria:
<p>

<UL>
<LI>oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content,
  and primer-dimer possibilities,

<LI>PCR product size,

<LI>positional constraints within the source sequence, and

<LI>miscellaneous other constraints.
</UL>

<p>

All of these criteria are user-specifiable as constraints.

<p>

<b>eprimer3</b> can also pick hybridisation oligos that are internal to
the product. 


<H3>ADVICE FOR PICKING PRIMERS</H3>

We suggest referring to: Wojciech Rychlik, "Selection of Primers
for Polymerase Chain Reaction" in BA White, Ed., "Methods in
Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and
Applications", 1993, pp 31-40, Humana Press, Totowa NJ

<H4>Cautions</H4>

Some of the most important issues in primer picking can be
addressed only before using eprimer3.  These are sequence quality
(including making sure the sequence is not vector and not
chimeric) and avoiding repetitive elements.

<p>

Techniques for avoiding problems include a thorough understanding
of possible vector contaminants and cloning artifacts coupled
with database searches using blast, fasta, or other similarity
searching program to screen for vector contaminants and possible
repeats.  Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature.  eprimer3 now allows you to screen candidate oligos
against a Mispriming Library (or a Mishyb Library in the case
of internal oligos).

<p>

Sequence quality can be controlled by manual trace viewing and
quality clipping or automatic quality clipping programs.  Low-
quality bases should be changed to N's or can be made part of
Excluded Regions. The beginning of a sequencing read is often
problematic because of primer peaks, and the end of the read
often contains many low-quality or even meaningless called bases.
Therefore when picking primers from single-pass sequence it is
often best to use the INCLUDED_REGION parameter to ensure that
eprimer3 chooses primers in the high quality region of the read.

<p>

In addition, eprimer3 takes as input a Sequence Quality list for
use with those base calling programs 

<p>

(e.g. Phred, Bass/Grace, Trout) that output this information.

<H4>What to do if eprimer3 cannot find a primers?</H4>

Try relaxing various parameters, including the
self-complementarity parameters and max and min oligo melting
temperatures.  For example, for very A-T-rich regions you might
have to increase maximum primer size or decrease minimum melting
temperature.  It is usually unwise to reduce the minimum primer
size if your template is complex (e.g. a mammalian genome), since
small primers are more likely to be non-specific.  Make sure that
there are adequate stretches of non-Ns in the regions in which
you wish to pick primers.  If necessary you can also allow an N
in your primer and use an oligo mixture containing all four bases
at that position.

<p>

Try setting the '-explain' option.

                                  The file must be in (a slightly restricted)
                                  FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman,
                                  PNAS 85:8 pp 2444-2448 [1988]); we briefly
                                  discuss the organization of this file below.
                                  If this parameter is specified then
                                  EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate oligo
                                  against each library sequence and rejects
                                  those primers for which the local alignment
                                  score times a specified weight (see below)
                                  exceeds INTERNAL-OLIGO-MAX-MISHYB. (The
                                  maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily
                                  set to 12.0.)
                                  Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file
                                  must begin with an 'id line' that starts
                                  with '>'. The contents of the id line is
                                  'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3
                                  parses everything after any optional
                                  asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to
                                  use as the weight mentioned above. If the
                                  id line contains no asterisk then the weight
                                  defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring
                                  system used is the same as for calculating
                                  complementarity among oligos (e.g.
                                  SELF-ANY). The remainder of an entry
                                  contains the sequence as lines following the
                                  id line up until a line starting with '>'
                                  or the end of the file. Whitespace and
                                  newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T',
                                  'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained
                                  and any other character is converted to 'N'
                                  (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC
                                  codes for ambiguous bases are converted to
                                  'N'). There are no restrictions on line
                                  length.
                                  An empty value for this parameter indicates
                                  that no library should be used.
   -numreturn          integer    [5] The maximum number of primer pairs to
                                  return. Primer pairs returned are sorted by
                                  their 'quality', in other words by the value
                                  of the objective function (where a lower
                                  number indicates a better primer pair).
                                  Caution: setting this parameter to a large
                                  value will increase running time. (Integer 0
                                  or more)
   -includedregion     range      [(full sequence)] A sub-region of the given
                                  sequence in which to pick primers. For
                                  example, often the first dozen or so bases
                                  of a sequence are vector, and should be
                                  excluded from consideration. The value for
                                  this parameter has the form
                                  (start),(end)
                                  where (start) is the index of the first base
                                  to consider, and (end) is the last in the
                                  primer-picking region.
   -target             range      [(full sequence)] If one or more Targets is
                                  specified then a legal primer pair must
                                  flank at least one of them. A Target might
                                  be a simple sequence repeat site (for
                                  example a CA repeat) or a single-base-pair
                                  polymorphism. The value should be a
                                  space-separated list of
                                  (start),(end)
                                  pairs where (start) is the index of the
                                  first base of a Target, and (end) is the
                                  last
                                  E.g. 50,51 requires primers to surround the
                                  2 bases at positions 50 and 51.
   -excludedregion     range      [(full sequence)] Primer oligos may not
                                  overlap any region specified in this tag.
                                  The associated value must be a
                                  space-separated list of
                                  (start),(end)
                                  pairs where (start) is the index of the
                                  first base of the excluded region, and and
                                  (end) is the last. This tag is useful for
                                  tasks such as excluding regions of low
                                  sequence quality or for excluding regions
                                  containing repetitive elements such as ALUs
                                  or LINEs.
                                  E.g. 401,407 68,70 forbids selection of
                                  primers in the 7 bases starting at 401 and
                                  the 3 bases at 68.
   -forwardinput       string     The sequence of a forward primer to check
                                  and around which to design reverse primers
                                  and optional internal oligos. Must be a
                                  substring of SEQUENCE. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
   -reverseinput       string     The sequence of a reverse primer to check
                                  and around which to design forward primers
                                  and optional internal oligos. Must be a
                                  substring of the reverse strand of SEQUENCE.
                                  (Any string is accepted)
*  -gcclamp            integer    [0] Require the specified number of
                                  consecutive Gs and Cs at the 3' end of both
                                  the forward and reverse primer. (This
                                  parameter has no effect on the internal
                                  oligo if one is requested.) (Integer 0 or
                                  more)
*  -osize              integer    [20] Optimum length (in bases) of a primer
                                  oligo. EPrimer3 will attempt to pick primers
                                  close to this length. (Integer 0 or more)
*  -minsize            integer    [18] Minimum acceptable length of a primer.
                                  Must be greater than 0 and less than or
                                  equal to MAX-SIZE. (Integer 1 or more)
*  -maxsize            integer    [27] Maximum acceptable length (in bases) of
                                  a primer. Currently this parameter cannot
                                  be larger than 35. This limit is governed by
                                  the maximum oligo size for which EPrimer3's
                                  melting-temperature is valid. (Integer up

*  -dnaconc            float      [50.0] The nanomolar concentration of

                                  with the standard protocol used at the

                                  degrees Celsius. This parameter corresponds
                                  to 'c' in Rychlik, Spencer and Rhoads'
                                  equation (ii) (Nucleic Acids Research, vol
                                  18, num 12) where a suitable value (for a
                                  lower initial concentration of template) is
                                  'empirically determined'. The value of this
                                  parameter is less than the actual
                                  concentration of oligos in the reaction
                                  because it is the concentration of annealing
                                  oligos, which in turn depends on the amount
                                  of template (including PCR product) in a
                                  given cycle. This concentration increases a
                                  great deal during a PCR; fortunately PCR
                                  seems quite robust for a variety of oligo
                                  melting temperatures.

                                  lengths for the product. For example, if one
                                  wants PCR products to be between 100 to 150
                                  bases (inclusive) then one would set this
                                  parameter to 100-150. If one desires PCR
                                  products in either the range from 100 to 150
                                  bases or in the range from 200 to 250 bases
                                  then one would set this parameter to
                                  100-150 200-250.

                                  Complementarity argument. In the examples
                                  above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00
                                  respectively. Scores are non-negative, and a
                                  score of 0.00 indicates that there is no
                                  reasonable 3'-anchored global alignment
                                  between two oligos. In order to estimate
                                  3'-anchored global alignments for candidate
                                  oligos, Primer assumes that the sequence
                                  from which to choose oligos is presented 5'
                                  to 3'.
                                  INTERNAL-OLIGO-SELF-END is meaningless when
                                  applied to internal oligos used for
                                  hybridization-based detection, since
                                  primer-dimer will not occur. We recommend
                                  that INTERNAL-OLIGO-SELF-END be set at least
                                  as high as INTERNAL-OLIGO-SELF-ANY. (Number
                                  up to 9999.990)
*  -oligomaxpolyx      integer    [5] The maximum allowable length of an

                                  example AAAAAA. (Integer 0 or more)
*  -oligomaxmishyb     float      [12.0] Similar to MAX-MISPRIMING except that
                                  this parameter applies to the similarity of
                                  candidate internal oligos to the library
                                  specified in INTERNAL-OLIGO-MISHYB-LIBRARY.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -mispriminglibraryfile infile     The name of a file containing a nucleotide
                                  sequence library of sequences to avoid
                                  amplifying (for example repetitive
                                  sequences, or possibly the sequences of
                                  genes in a gene family that should not be
                                  amplified.) The file must be in (a slightly
                                  restricted) FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and
                                  D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp 2444-2448 [1988]);
                                  we briefly discuss the organization of this
                                  file below. If this parameter is specified
                                  then EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate
                                  primer against each library sequence and
                                  rejects those primers for which the local
                                  alignment score times a specified weight
                                  (see below) exceeds MAX-MISPRIMING. (The
                                  maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily
                                  set to 100.0.)
                                  Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file
                                  must begin with an 'id line' that starts
                                  with '>'. The contents of the id line is
                                  'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3
                                  parses everything after any optional
                                  asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to
                                  use as the weight mentioned above. If the
                                  id line contains no asterisk then the weight
                                  defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring
                                  system used is the same as for calculating
                                  complementarity among oligos (e.g.
                                  SELF-ANY). The remainder of an entry
                                  contains the sequence as lines following the
                                  id line up until a line starting with '>'
                                  or the end of the file. Whitespace and
                                  newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T',
                                  'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained
                                  and any other character is converted to 'N'
                                  (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC
                                  codes for ambiguous bases are converted to
                                  'N'). There are no restrictions on line
                                  length.
                                  An empty value for this parameter indicates
                                  that no repeat library should be used.
   -explainflag        boolean    [N] If this flag is true, produce

                                  INTERNAL-OLIGO-EXPLAIN output tags, which
                                  are intended to provide information on the
                                  number of oligos and primer pairs that
                                  EPrimer3 examined, and statistics on the
                                  number discarded for various reasons.
   -fileflag           boolean    [N] If the associated value is true, then
                                  EPrimer3 creates two output files for each
                                  input SEQUENCE. File (sequence-id).for lists
                                  all acceptable forward primers for
                                  (sequence-id), and (sequence-id).rev lists
                                  all acceptable reverse primers for
                                  (sequence-id), where (sequence-id) is the
                                  value of the SEQUENCE-ID tag (which must be
                                  supplied). In addition, if the input tag
                                  TASK is 1 or 4, EPrimer3 produces a file
                                  (sequence-id).int, which lists all
                                  acceptable internal oligos.
   -firstbaseindex     integer    [1] This parameter is the index of the first
                                  base in the input sequence. For input and

                                  used in GenBank and to which many users are
                                  accustomed) set this parameter to 1. For
                                  input and output using 0-based indexing set
                                  this parameter to 0. (This parameter also
                                  affects the indexes in the contents of the
                                  files produced when the primer file flag is
                                  set.) (Any integer value)
   -pickanyway         boolean    [N] If true pick a primer pair even if
                                  LEFT-INPUT, RIGHT-INPUT, or
                                  INTERNAL-OLIGO-INPUT violates specific
                                  constraints.

                                  similarity with any sequence in
                                  MISPRIMING-LIBRARY. (Number up to 9999.990)
   -pairmaxmispriming  float      [24.00] The maximum allowed sum of weighted

                                  similarity for each primer) with any single
                                  sequence in MISPRIMING-LIBRARY. (Number up
                                  to 9999.990)
   -numnsaccepted      integer    [0] Maximum number of unknown bases (N)
                                  allowable in any primer. (Integer 0 or more)
   -selfany            float      [8.00] The maximum allowable local alignment
                                  score when testing a single primer for
                                  (local) self-complementarity and the maximum
                                  allowable local alignment score when
                                  testing for complementarity between forward
                                  and reverse primers. Local
                                  self-complementarity is taken to predict the
                                  tendency of primers to anneal to each other
                                  without necessarily causing self-priming in
                                  the PCR. The scoring system gives 1.00 for
                                  complementary bases, -0.25 for a match of
                                  any base (or N) with an N, -1.00 for a
                                  mismatch, and -2.00 for a gap. Only
                                  single-base-pair gaps are allowed. For
                                  example, the alignment

                                  and a score of 0.00 indicates that there is
                                  no reasonable local alignment between two
                                  oligos. (Number from 0.000 to 9999.990)
   -selfend            float      [3.00] The maximum allowable 3'-anchored
                                  global alignment score when testing a single
                                  primer for self-complementarity, and the
                                  maximum allowable 3'-anchored global
                                  alignment score when testing for

                                  primers. The 3'-anchored global alignment
                                  score is taken to predict the likelihood of
                                  PCR-priming primer-dimers, for example

                                  The scoring system is as for the Maximum
                                  Complementarity argument. In the examples
                                  above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00
                                  respectively. Scores are non-negative, and a
                                  score of 0.00 indicates that there is no
                                  reasonable 3'-anchored global alignment
                                  between two oligos. In order to estimate

                                  primers and primer pairs, Primer assumes
                                  that the sequence from which to choose
                                  primers is presented 5' to 3'. It is
                                  nonsensical to provide a larger value for
                                  this parameter than for the Maximum (local)
                                  Complementarity parameter because the score
                                  of a local alignment will always be at least
                                  as great as the score of a global

                                  numbers mean more stable 3' ends. The value
                                  is the maximum delta G for duplex

<td>Similar to MISPRIMING-LIBRARY, except that the event we seek to avoid is hybridization of the internal oligo to sequences in this library rather than priming from them.
The file must be in (a slightly restricted) FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp 2444-2448 [1988]); we briefly discuss the organization of this file below. If this parameter is specified then EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate oligo against each library sequence and rejects those primers for which the local alignment score times a specified weight (see below) exceeds INTERNAL-OLIGO-MAX-MISHYB. (The maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 12.0.)
Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file must begin with an 'id line' that starts with '&gt;'. The contents of the id line is 'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3 parses everything after any optional asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to use as the weight mentioned above. If the id line contains no asterisk then the weight defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring system used is the same as for calculating complementarity among oligos (e.g. SELF-ANY). The remainder of an entry contains the sequence as lines following the id line up until a line starting with '&gt;' or the end of the file. Whitespace and newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained and any other character is converted to 'N' (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC codes for ambiguous bases are converted to 'N'). There are no restrictions on line length.

This parameter corresponds to 'c' in Rychlik, Spencer and Rhoads' equation (ii) (Nucleic Acids Research, vol 18, num 12) where a suitable value (for a lower initial concentration of template) is 'empirically determined'. The value of this parameter is less than the actual concentration of oligos in the reaction because it is the concentration of annealing oligos, which in turn depends on the amount of template (including PCR product) in a given cycle. This concentration increases a great deal during a PCR; fortunately PCR seems quite robust for a variety of oligo melting temperatures.

EPrimer3 favors ranges to the left side of the parameter string. EPrimer3 will return legal primers pairs in the first range regardless the value of the objective function for these pairs.

Tm = 81.5 + 16.6(log10([Na+])) + .41*(%GC) - 600/length
Where [Na+} is the molar sodium concentration, (%GC) is the percent of Gs and Cs in the sequence, and length is the length of the sequence.
A similar formula is used by the prime primer selection program in GCG http://www.gcg.com), which instead uses 675.0/length in the last term (after F. Baldino, Jr, M.-F. Chesselet, and M.E. Lewis, Methods in Enzymology 168:766 (1989) eqn (1) on page 766 without the mismatch and formamide terms). The formulas here and in Baldino et al. assume Na+ rather than K+. According to J.G. Wetmur, Critical Reviews in BioChem. and Mol. Bio. 26:227 (1991) 50 mM K+ should be equivalent in these formulae to .2 M Na+. EPrimer3 uses the same salt concentration value for calculating both the primer melting temperature and the oligo melting temperature. If you are planning to use the PCR product for hybridization later this behavior will not give you the Tm under hybridization conditions.</td>

If the '-explain' flag has been used, as in the example, then statistics
are output describing the number of primers that were considered and
rejected for various reasons. 

<p>

Headers describing the input file name and the names of the output
columns are displayed.

<p>

The best 5 primer pairs are displayed with the product size.

<p>

The reverse sequence is displayed as the reverse complement to the input
forward sense sequence. 

<p>

The 'Start' positions are given counting from the start of the sequence
for both the forward and reverse primer (and for the internal oligos). 

<p>

Note that if you compare the results to the output from the public
Primer3 web site you will see a difference in the reverse primer
positions - this is because the original Primer3 program reports the
reverse primer positions as counted from the 3' end.  The convention in
EMBOSS is to report both forward and reverse features as counted from
the 5' end, so the reverse primer positions are given counted from the
5' start of the sequence.

    History
</H2>

Written (Dec 2001) - Gary Williams

<p>

Changed name (version 2.3.0) - Gary Williams

<p>

When I wrote the EMBOSS wrapper for the Whitehead's primer3 version
3.0.9 program, I called it 'primer3'.  This did not conflict with the
Whitehead program becuase although the package is called 'primer3' the
program itself is called primer3_core. 

<p>

I wasn't aware that the Whitehead's primer3 version 3.0.6 program was
itself called 'primer3'.  This caused a name conflict in those sites
with version 3.0.6 installed. 

<p>

To avoid the conflict, the EMBOSS program was renamed 'eprimer3'. 
eprimer3 was released in version 2.3.0 of EMBOSS
