<H2>
    Function
</H2>
Creates a consensus from multiple alignments
<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>cons</b> calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence
alignment.  To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring
matrix are used to calculate a score at each position in the alignment. 
<P>

The residue (or nucleotide) <b>i</b> in an alignment column, is compared
to all other residues (<b>j</b>) in the column.  The score for <b>i</b>
is the sum over all residues <b>j</b> (not <b>i=j</b>) of the
score(<b>ij</b>)*weight(<b>j</b>) .  Where score(<b>ij</b>) is taken
from a nucleotide or protein scoring matrix (see <b>-datafile</b>
qualifier) and the "weight(<b>j</b>)" is the weighting given to the
sequence <b>j</b>, which is given in the alignment file.
<P>

The highest scoring type of residue is then found in the column.  If the
number of positive matches for this residue is greater than the
"plurality value" then this residue is the consensus.  The positive
matches for a residue <b>i</b> are calculated as being the sum of
weights of all the residues that increase the score of residue <b>i</b>
(i.e.  positive). 
<P>

Where no consensus is found at a position <b>i</b>, an 'n' or an 'x'
character is output; (depending on it being a DNA or protein sequence).
<P>

   The "plurality" qualifier allows the user to set a cut-off for the
number of positive matches below which there is no consensus.
<P>

    The "identity" qualifier provides the facility of setting the required
number of identities at a site for it to give a consensus at that
position.  Therefore, if this is set to the number of sequences in the
alignment only columns of identities contribute to the consensus. 
<P>

    The "setcase" qualifier sets the threshold for the positive matches
above which the consensus is is upper-case and below which the consensus
is in lower-case. 
<P>

<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqset     File containing a sequence alignment.
  [-outseq]            seqout     [<sequence>.<format>] Sequence filename and
                                  optional format (output USA)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     [EBLOSUM62 for protein, EDNAFULL for DNA]
                                  This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.

                                  below which there is no consensus. The
                                  default plurality is taken as half the total
                                  weight of all the sequences in the
                                  alignment. (Any numeric value)
   -identity           integer    [0] Provides the facility of setting the
                                  required number of identities at a site for
                                  it to give a consensus at that position.
                                  Therefore, if this is set to the number of
                                  sequences in the alignment only columns of
                                  identities contribute to the consensus.

   -setcase            float      [@( $(sequence.totweight) / 2)] Sets the
                                  threshold for the positive matches above
                                  which the consensus is is upper-case and
                                  below which the consensus is in lower-case.
                                  (Any numeric value)
   -name               string     Name of the consensus sequence (Any string

    Data files
</H2>

It uses the standard set of scoring matrix data files.
<P>
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
