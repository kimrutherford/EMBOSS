# small nucleolar RNA molecules mostly involved in rRNA modification
# and processing;

# SO: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing
# and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main
# classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3
# snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element
# is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3
# snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA
# secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with
# boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and
# D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B
# and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3
# snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is
# functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The
# 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The
# 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and
# box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3
# snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar
# localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box
# B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions
# and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.

# mature transfer RNA, a small RNA molecule (75-85 bases long) that

# acid sequence;

# SO: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides
# in length. Their secondary structure includes four short
# double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T
# loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped
# molecular structure. tRNAs have two regions of fundamental
# functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for
# specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNA's
# corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA
# synthetases). tRNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in
# two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon)
# for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing,
# i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon
# position.
